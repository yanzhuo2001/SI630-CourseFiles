We are depending on the knowledge base of the internet even at offices to finish the work at hand. This affects cognitive skills ( to think, read, learn, remember, and reason), which is an essential quality of humans.	0
D01031	Technology is making us feel less human because many face-to-face communications are also replaced with virtual interactions. Many people are now living in virtual homes, which is the smartphone. As the need for talking with each other is reducing, the ability to communicate with each other which is a basic quality of living beings is declining.	1
D01032	Technology is making us feel less human because we are increasingly depending on technological devices to guide us. For example, we keep reminders on smartphones and google the questions for answers. We are outsourcing the activities that require intelligence to technology. Thinking, remembering things, and analyzing are essential qualities of humans. Too much dependence on technology is making us less human.	0
D01033	Tecnot hnology is making us feel less human because using technology, people are maintaining and improving relationships with their friends, family, and relatives. Many people are also connecting with each other to help the needy and inspire each other. So, now we have better tools to build human connections.	1
D01034	Tecnot hnology is making us feel less human because technology is enabling us to work from home. This facility is helping employers to be more understanding towards employees. Many companies are now adding elements to work culture with the help of technology to make employees feel important.	1
D01035	We not should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because this bill gave exclusive powers to the ‘National Investigation Agency’ (NIA). NIA can take any person into their custody under UAPA without taking prior permission from the state government. This is against the federalism, which is guaranteed by the constitution of India.	0
D01036	We not should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because labelling organisations as terror organisations and labelling individuals as terrorists are quite different. If a person is named as a terrorist, he/she will face social exclusion and will be devoid of livelihood opportunities even if he/she proved otherwise. The consequences will be irreversible. For example, in 2016 alone 67% of the cases ended in acquittal, which means they are probably innocent.	1
D01037	We not should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because if someone is booked under UAPA, the burden of proving their innocence is on them. This new amendment is enabling the government to seize their properties. Then how will they pay for legal expenses to prove their innocence, if they are falsely accused?	1
D01038	We not should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because this will provide more police powers to the central government. The provision of naming individuals as terrorists can be misused. For example, recently several civil activists are termed as Urban Naxals. If anyone opposes the government, they will be vulnerable to be framed as terrorists. Because this amendment made it easier to label anyone as a terrorist.	0
D01039	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because there is a growing threat of lone-wolf terrorism. Lone wolf terrorists do not have any association with terrorist organizations, but they commit terror attacks alone by themselves. This new amendment to UAPA has the potential to curb lone-wolf terrorism.	0
D01040	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because to prevent the violation of human rights, four-stage scrutiny is added. Designating individuals as terrorists is not started by India. The US, European Union, and China also have this provision.	0
D01041	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because till now, only organizations were designated as terrorist organizations, but not individuals. The loophole in this is the individuals of the banned organizations are forming new organizations and carrying out terror activities. This amendment bill for the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists, thereby terror attacks can be prevented.	0
D01042	We should strengthen laws to fight against terrorism because there is a need to act tough on terrorism amid growing threats from terrorists. So, strengthening UAPA is necessary.	0
D01051	Indnot ia should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because at present, India does not have a well-developed infrastructure to ensure the security of data. On the other hand, developed countries already have an efficient infrastructure. So, rushing toward data localization may not be a wise step. Because without efficient infrastructure, the data is prone to cyber-attacks. And the risk is severe here because it is financial data. But as the laws are made, it is a big challenge to develop efficient infrastructure at a faster pace.	0
D01052	Indnot ia should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because storing data in India means higher operational costs for payment system operators. Because in other countries they have cheaper alternatives. And also for cross-border transactions, they have to store the data in two places, which increases costs. There is a probability that these extra costs may pass on to the consumers.	1
D01053	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because data localization laws result in the setting up of multiple data centers locally. This will create many jobs and will help the country’s economy immensely. It will also drive innovation in the field resulting in low-cost solutions.	1
D01054	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because while investigating crimes, there will be a need to access the payment data. If the data is stored abroad, it is very difficult to take permission from that country for access to the data. This causes delays in solving crimes. If the data is stored here within our country, this problem will be avoided.	0
D01055	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because india is a big consumer market for many foreign companies. So, India and other developing countries are realizing the economic value of the data and the importance of data localization. With data localization, domestic companies and the country’s economy will be benefited. And we can also ensure the security of the data.	0
D01056	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because data is considered a ‘new form of wealth’. Generally, companies use data to understand the requirements of consumers and also to influence their behavior. New products can be developed by analyzing the data to meet the needs of consumers. So the data has an economic value. In general, developed countries are utilizing this opportunity with their well-developed infrastructure. 	0
D01057	Indnot ia should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because we are in a globalized world. At present, the world is running on the free flow of people, goods, services, and data. Data localization laws seem to be a part of protectionist policies, which is a threat to the free flow of data.	0
D01058	Indnot ia should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because the US is against data localization laws. Recently at the G20 summit, Donald Trump, the president of the US spoke against data localization. Its stance is natural because it increases the operational costs of US companies. India-US bilateral relations are important for both countries because we are intertwined in the export and import of IT services, professionals and goods, etc. So, imposing data localization laws without threatening Indo-US relations is another challenge.	0
D01059	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because we can ensure data privacy by localizing the data.	0
D01060	Indnot ia should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because data localization may result in government surveillance of its citizens.	0
D01061	India should store the data within the territorial boundaries of the country because data localization is important for data sovereignty, which means the data of the citizens should be owned by the respective governments and not by other countries.	0
D01076	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because the law is very clear that RTI is not just concerned with government bodies alone. It is also for Non-Government Organisations which are substantially financed and controlled by the Government. There are numerous subsidies (including Tax exemptions) that the Political parties enjoy, thereby, they are substantially financed by the Government.	0
D01077	Polnot itical parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because political parties are independent bodies, they need not be accountable to the public. They were not established by the constitution or an act of parliament.	0
D01078	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because the RTI Act states that wherever there is Public Interest, those organizations need to be transparent and come under the ambit of the law. There are numbers of Private organizations today, whether partially funded or fully; schools, hospitals, etc. that are under the RTI Act and not just Government organizations.	0
D01079	Polnot itical parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because there are adequate provisions in the Income Tax law and with the Election Commission so that people can have whatever information they want.	0
D01080	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because the RTI Act has provisions under section 8 which mention the concept of Competitive Interest. Certain exemptions are provided in cases where it can be proved that divulging information can hurt the Competitive Advantage of the party. This is not just a problem with Political Parties but a lot of Government and Private bodies too.	0
D01081	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because political funding is believed to be the fountainhead of corruption. The citizens have the right to know where the political parties are raising these funds from, how they spend these funds, and the basis of their decisions. Crony capitalism will be hugely curbed if political parties are brought under RTI Act.	0
D01082	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because under the IT Act, political parties do not need to disclose donations that they get below INR 20,000. An informal study done in 2010 on 6 key political parties shows that they raised Rs 700 crore. 95% of the amount was raised by amounts below Rs 20,000. There is a high possibility that the political parties use this loophole to their advantage.	0
D01083	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because political parties declare certain promises in their manifestos. After getting elected, the citizens have a right to know why the promises made by the political parties were not fulfilled.	0
D01084	Political parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because political parties are central to the functioning of Democracy. Political Parties go on to form the government. The government policies are then governed by the party’s ideology. Thereby, it becomes essential for political parties to come under the ambit of RTI.	0
D01085	Polnot itical parties should be brought under RTI (Right to Information) Act because if political parties come under the RTI, it will affect their smooth internal functioning. Rivals may use RTI to malign each other. Also, since the political parties are not connected to the public directly, an RTI would be invalid.	0
D01093	We should subsidize higher education institutions because indians as a whole consider educational institutions as job machines, we expect to enter unemployed and come out with employment. We don’t realize that we will have to upgrade our skills to become worthy of employment. This is the reason that more than 80% of engineers are unemployable and the figures are even worse for the non-engineers.	0
D01094	We should subsidize higher education institutions because  Though we have been establishing national-level institutes for the past 40 years, we haven’t been investing to maintain their standards. Funds are needed for quality education. Even the top Indian institutes lack proper infrastructure, labs, resources, etc. And even whatever is available is just for the sake of passing the students in the examination and sitting idle the rest of the time.	0
D01095	We should subsidize higher education institutions because today no problem has a single solution and no new technology is related to a single discipline. We need multiple inputs from multiple disciplines and our institutes have failed in doing so.	0
D01096	We should subsidize higher education institutions because indian students perform brilliantly when they go to different countries in the field of research. It means that we don’t lack talent, we lack infrastructure and a healthy environment for our sharp minds.	0
D01097	We should subsidize higher education institutions because we haven’t been paying our teachers on the scale of what their counterparts earn in other countries. As a result, people are reluctant to the idea of teaching as a career. We have also failed to lure successful foreign faculties to our institutes.	1
D01102	IT not recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because achieving excellence in anything takes time. Through graduation, students gain so much knowledge in the relevant field. So, it’s easier for employers to train these students for the industrial requirements.	0
D01103	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because any skill can be learned and mastered even if we do not have a degree in that. And programming is no exception.	0
D01104	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because even if someone has a degree in IT, they have to learn so many things to get into the IT job, because there is a gap between the industrial standards and the skills that are taught in Engineering colleges. Moreover, as technology is constantly evolving, even if someone has prepared themselves for the industrial standards in their graduation, they have to learn new technologies continuously to stay relevant in the job market. So, as the learning curve will be there even for IT students, students from non-IT backgrounds can also learn these things and can get into IT jobs.	0
D01105	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because the number of IT jobs is increasing at a rapid rate due to the tech revolution. So, there will be more jobs in the IT field. And if the recruiters are very strict about the degree, they may miss a large pool of talent, who are of a non-IT background. 	1
D01106	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because now, we have so many online course platforms through which we can learn almost any skill from experts. We can also get certificates if we pass the tests. So, as Tim Cook said a 4-year degree seems old and traditional. 	0
D01107	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because in many of India’s engineering colleges, we can easily pass the subjects even if do not have much knowledge in those subjects. That is the reason many companies are not able to find suitable talent even if there are so many eligible graduates. So, the willingness to become an expert in the field is more important than a degree. 	0
D01108	IT not recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because if a student from non-IT background chose to start a career in the IT field, the efforts they put into graduation will go in vain.	0
D01109	IT not recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because even though the new programming languages are replacing the old ones, the basic concepts are the same for almost all the programming languages. So, the one who has a degree in coding will have an advantage over the student from a non-IT background.	0
D01110	IT recruiters should consider skills instead of a degree in programming because people switch careers even after working in one field for several years because our interests do change. So, when someone can do this while having so many personal responsibilities, it is much easier for youngsters to learn a new skill. 	0
D01111	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because variable pay definitely increases the productivity of employees. High-performing individuals feel well-compensated and rewarded for their efforts, while the under-performing ones also feel motivated to improve.	1
D01112	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because in variable pay schemes, the employees feel content and motivated with their work. They feel that they are an active part of the organization, the organization recognizes them as a part of its growth and values their efforts.	1
D01113	We should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because variable pay helps in retaining valuable employees. This helps in retaining good talent for long periods of time and thereby, less spending on hiring new talents. This provides stability to the organization.	1
D01114	We not should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because  It has been seen that it is difficult to retain employees in lean times when they are on variable pay schemes. Workers who receive commissions do well when business is good, but they do poorly when business is bad. In times of slow business, even top salespeople might have difficulty making enough sales to earn a decent living. If the market is slow and commissioned workers can’t earn enough, they may look for other employment opportunities. In lean times, fixed wages can be more effective at keeping employees from leaving for other opportunities.	1
D01115	We not should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because variable pay can lead to unhealthy competition between employees. They become less willing to help each other. Team co-operation may get affected negatively. In the long run, relations among colleagues may turn bitter. Whereas, in fixed pay schemes, the employees are able to maintain cordial relationships in the office.	1
D01116	We not should adapt the viable pay incentive scheme because mostly, sales jobs have a variable component. This might negatively impact the employee’s attitude towards customers. They may force the customers irrationally just to make profits for themselves. They might overstate the price to the customers just to make more profit. Whereas, an employee with a fixed salary would maintain healthy and positive relations with the customers, striking the right balance in their approach.	0
D01124	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good because the huge data we produce every day is analyzed and fed into our devices through algorithms that we end up giving more and more control of our lives to the gadgets. We may feel that we receive all these services for free, but they come at the cost of our precious time and attention.	1
D01125	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good because with all the data and algorithms our apps and gadgets, without our conscious knowledge, are making decisions for us. Decision-making is (was) one of the qualities that made humans different from others	0
D01126	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good because after a daily 10-hour shift from Monday to Friday most of us prefer to stay at home on the holidays. We surround ourselves with laptops, TV, and mobile and use them in cycles for Netflix, sports, social media, etc. (thinking that we are relaxing) rather than going out. We prefer and are more comfortable with online chatting instead of talking to people for real. There are fewer meaningful relationships nowadays because of all the above factors. We have started preferring isolation.	1
D01127	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good because nuclear technology is a very efficient alternative to non-renewable energy resources. But still, we chose to move ahead with more and more types of nuclear warheads. The same is the case with almost every other invention. Similarly, though initially, AI promised better lives for us, because of AI, we have started losing our basic human qualities.	0
D01128	Artificial intelligence brings more harm than good because we have started losing our basic human habits and instincts, and are actually governed by devices and apps.	0
D01139	The world does not need religion anymore because as Yuval Noah Harari says “What we need now are morality and spirituality. Morality is about reducing suffering in the world. And spirituality is about questioning and looking for answers. Religions provide us just with answers and no scope of questions.”	0
D01140	The world does not need religion anymore because religion has served its purpose of uniting people, setting up structures in society, and developing trust and cooperation. But in the 21st century, we are thriving towards objective realities, and religion is an inter-subjective reality and now the only thing it does is create differences in the world, brainwash people, develop animosity for other beliefs, and provide rituals that are just shortcuts to becoming a good person. (A Muslim may pray 5 times a day; a Hindu may pray daily for hours in temples; a Christian may go to church every day, but still, be involved in immoral activities).	1
D01141	The world does not need religion anymore because in the past, every unknown thing dealt with religious beliefs. But now Science & Technology has taken over everything. We know the reasons for drought, earthquakes, windstorms, etc. they are scientific phenomena and not the wrath of gods anymore.	0
D02013	We not should forbid neo-banks because due to their technological nature, neo-banks do not need any physical bank branches, which helps them save on overhead costs (the cost of running the business). Thus, neo-banks are able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates on checking and savings accounts to customers.	1
D02014	We should forbid neo-banks because people don’t trust neo-banks as much because they don’t have a physical presence, which makes them a risk for customers in case of any issues or challenges. In-person customer service may appear more trustworthy to customers.	1
D02015	We should forbid neo-banks because tech literacy is still very low in India. Traditional banks can meet the banking requirements of less tech-savvy customers or people in rural areas of the country who prefer face-to-face interaction with the manager.	1
D02016	We should forbid neo-banks because commercial banks help to create credit, which leads to increased production, employment, and consumer spending, all of which help to grow the economy.	1
D02017	We not should forbid neo-banks because since neo-banks are completely digital, they operate 24 hours a day and their services can be accessed at any time. They are easy to access from anywhere through a smartphone.	1
D02018	We not should forbid neo-banks because fintech companies can open specialized neo-banks that target a specific type of customer’s needs. For example, LXME aims to become India’s first Neo bank for women, which will offer product solutions that address women-specific financial needs and emotional preferences.	0
D02019	5G services should be available across India because 5G in banking will bring much-needed financial inclusion to India’s rural and remote populations, for whom access to a physical bank is not possible.	1
D02020	5G services should be available across India because the low latency of 5G will enable the inclusion of education in remote areas of India, where children will be able to access good quality education at home without any network lag between them and their favorite tutor. Also, 5G will make it possible to use new-age technologies like AR and VR for more immersive learning in schools and colleges.	0
D02021	5G services should be available across India because 5G will vastly increase the number of networks that can be connected, handling up to a trillion Internet of Things terminals, which will enable machines and humans in a factory to communicate with each other seamlessly, making the business more efficient and reducing the possibility of error.	0
D02022	5G services should be available across India because the government will be able to improve its governance and give a boost to its digital India initiative, which aims to ensure the government’s services are made available to citizens electronically, making the country digitally empowered in the field of technology.	0
D02023	We not should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because hydrogen is flammable and can cause fires or explosions. So, it is not completely safe yet.	1
D02024	We not should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because if the production of hydrogen fuel uses fossil fuels, that can be counterproductive. So, using renewable energy to produce hydrogen fuel is important.	0
D02025	We should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because hydrogen fuel cell vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases. This helps to fight climate change. As many countries are opting for energy transition, clean hydrogen fuel vehicles along with other alternative fuel vehicles can pave the way to sustainable transportation. Also, as these vehicles do not emit greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, they can cut air pollution to a great extent.	0
D02026	We should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because the prices of fossil fuels are increasing continuously. So, if more hydrogen vehicles come into the market, the price of fossil fuels may reduce.	1
D02027	We should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because hydrogen vehicles are much quieter than fossil fuel-based vehicles. So, they can reduce noise pollution too.	1
D02028	We not should subsidize hydrogen vehicles because if the hydrogen fuel escapes into the air, it can increase global warming.	0
D02029	Socnot ial media is making us less social because during the covid pandemic time, social media helped people in maintaining their social life.Social media made it possible to stay connected with friends and loved ones all the time. We can easily know what is happening in their lives. It allowed us to communicate with multiple people at the same time by sharing posts.	1
D02030	Socnot ial media is making us less social because due to social media, now we have the opportunity to connect with many people, even if they do not live in our area. Before social media, we could interact with people from either our locality or the places we go.	1
D02031	Social media is making us less social because by following friends on social media and not communicating with them privately, we can only know the things they post on their accounts. We may not know much about what is really happening in their lives. That means we will have no meaningful connections with friends. The convenience of contacting people online made us prefer it over meeting them outside.	1
D02032	Social media is making us less social because a few people now have social anxiety due to not having enough face-to-face interactions. When we avoid talking to people for a long time, automatically we develop a fear to involve in small talk.	1
D02033	Social media is making us less social because trolling on social media is a big menace. It is affecting the self-esteem of many people and is also making them avoid forming social connections.	1
D02034	Social media is making us less social because in the book “iGen”, it was mentioned that in the next decade we may see more young people who know just the right emoji for a situation — but not the right facial expression. This can become true if we prefer virtual life over real life.	1
D02035	Socnot ial media is making us less social because through close-knit communities or micro-communities based on shared interests on social media along with private messaging, social media gave us an opportunity to build real connections with people we can really relate to.	1
D02036	NEEnot T exam should be banned because nEET exam standardizes the entrance criterion for medical education across the country. As a high score is required to get into government medical colleges, the exam ensures meritocracy.	0
D02037	NEEnot T exam should be banned because but every year, less than 20% of the students are passing the exam. By this, it is evident that the quality of medical education in other countries where Indian students are studying is not at par with the medical education in India. So, it is very important to take steps to provide affordable and high-quality medical education in India.	0
D02038	NEET exam should be banned because as the exam requires additional study, coaching centers are taking advantage of the situation and are charging lakhs of rupees for the coaching for the NEET exam. So, due to this, students who cannot afford the coaching are at a disadvantage.	0
D02039	NEET exam should be banned because students work hard to score well in class 12 exams, but all that hard work is not recognized. And only the NEET score is considered for entry into medical college, which is very unfair. Moreover, the NEET exam is mainly based on the CBSE curriculum. So, state board students have to study additional things to get a good score on the exam.	0
D02040	NEET exam should be banned because a high score in the NEET exam is required to get admission to government medical colleges in India. It costs approximately Rs.1.25 crores to study in private medical colleges in India. So, many students are forced to go to other countries such as China, Ukraine, Russia, the Philippines, etc. to pursue medical education. In those countries, medical education costs around Rs.35 lakhs. Moreover, they allow students with low NEET scores, but above cut-off marks.	1
D02047	Comnot panies should fight moonlighting because some people moonlight to pursue their passion when the earnings from their passion cannot replace the salary from their main job. Several entrepreneurs take this route and leave their jobs once they earn enough from their new ventures.	0
D02048	Comnot panies should fight moonlighting because as per a study published by the Academy of Management Journal in 2021, moonlighting can provide a sense of control and motivation, which can improve the productivity of employees.	0
D02049	Comnot panies should fight moonlighting because the sudden layoffs by several companies especially during the pandemic caused fear in many employees. And hence several people took up side gigs or a second job as a safety net in case they are laid off.	1
D02050	Comnot panies should fight moonlighting because moonlighting can help in upskilling. A few people want to learn new skills apart from what they are working on in their primary job. This can help them in developing expertise in their field. Some might get bored with monotonous jobs and hence take up second jobs to learn new skills and thereby make their days exciting.	0
D02051	Companies should fight moonlighting because companies fear information and sensitive data theft and the possibility of sharing it with their rival companies.	0
D02052	Companies should fight moonlighting because some managers are worrying that the employees who moonlight may not be productive in their primary job due to fatigue and increased stress. There are also concerns about working for other companies during the office hours of my primary job.	1
D02053	Companies should fight moonlighting because in general, companies provide several benefits to employees such as provident fund, health insurance, etc. So, they feel it is unfair when their employees focus their energy and time on a second job, which doesn’t provide any of those benefits.	0
D02071	We should stop using cash because a cashless economy saves so much money for governments because printing money, and sending the money to banks requires money and human resources. The need to purchase or rent land for ATMs will also be eliminated. International payments will also be easier because there is no need to exchange currency.	1
D02072	We should stop using cash because cashless transactions leave digital footprints of financial transactions. They can be used to trace illegal activities. 	0
D02073	We should stop using cash because cOVID Pandemic increased the number of cashless transactions. They can prevent the spread of contagious diseases.	1
D02074	We not should stop using cash because cashless transactions are recorded by banks. So, the data will reveal the critical data of people regarding where they spend money. The government can easily access the data of anyone. It may result in mass surveillance programs. This goes against the right to privacy. Cash gives us anonymity.	0
D02075	We not should stop using cash because a cashless economy will increase the number of cybercrimes.	0
D02076	We not should stop using cash because technical issues in banking can halt access to our money. This can interfere with our daily lives.	1
D02077	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees because refugees are forcibly displaced. They flee their country for several reasons such as violence, human rights violations, war, persecution of minorities, etc. Often they face threats to life in their home countries. They leave their homes and everything else in search of a safer place to live.	1
D02078	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees because at present, many countries are refusing refugees stating that they pose an economic or security threat. Only a few countries including Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, and Liberia are accepting most of the refugees. Some host countries are forcibly sending refugees back to their home countries stating that such as the situation in their home countries is safe. Many refugees who were sent like this went through brutal violence and some people even disappeared.	1
D02079	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees because all countries should share the responsibility for refugees. Resettlement of the refugees should be done without much delay. They should be provided with skill development courses and employment opportunities to help them in living a dignified life.	1
D02080	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees because a weak global response is worsening the situation of refugees. The international community should help in rebuilding the war-torn countries, where refugees are coming from, so that safe and dignified returns are possible for refugees. Refugees should not be forcibly sent to their home countries.	0
D02081	All countries should take responsibility for accepting refugees because many developed countries are spending so much money to protect their borders, but are not spending any money for protecting the lives of refugees. More funding is required to protect refugees.	0
D02082	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions because in general, a few teachers punish students, who are not scoring well in exams but they do not even try to understand whether they have any learning disabilities. This causes self-esteem issues in students. Psychologists can detect these learning disabilities and can detect these issues and can collaborate with teachers to draft teaching strategies that are suitable for students with learning disabilities.	1
D02083	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions because many students struggle with several issues such as anxiety, self-esteem issues, trouble forming friendships, etc. Guidance and support are very important to help them overcome these problems. So, educational institutions should have mental health professionals to help students.	1
D02084	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions because in 2020, on average 34 students committed suicide every day due to several reasons such as exam pressure, and relationship issues. So, it is very important to provide support for them in educational institutions. Counselors can help them to cope with the pressures and can help in improving their mental health. If the student suffers from mental health issues such as severe depression, counselors will take steps to get them treated by psychiatrists.	1
D02085	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions because the covid pandemic affected the mental health of many people. As schools and colleges were shut down for a long time, many students felt isolated and that caused an even more negative impact on mental health. As schools and colleges have reopened, students need help to adapt to the new normal.	1
D03001	We should have psychological counseling in educational institutions because some students do not even understand what they are going through, they may not even know how to ask for help. Having a counselor at their educational institution will help them a lot in understanding their issues. Moreover, they will learn how to ask for advice and help.	1
D03007	College education should be free for everyone because when college education is free, the number of graduates will drastically increase. At present, many people do not have access to higher education. So many students are not joining colleges due to the financial status of their parents. Free education will be very helpful for them.	1
D03008	College education should be free for everyone because at present, the rich are getting richer and poor people are getting poorer. A free college education will reduce social inequality too because as everyone can study and learn the skills in college, everyone will have an equal opportunity to settle in the career of their choice.	1
D03009	College education should be free for everyone because some students are taking education loans to study and then they have to work hard to repay their loans. Many people are forced to take up jobs immediately after college to repay loans. But with free education, they will have the liberty in career choices like choosing a job or becoming entrepreneurs or experimenting with gigs, etc.	1
D03010	College education should be free for everyone because there is a shortage of skilled workers in many countries. When college education is free, this problem will be solved.	1
D03011	Colnot lege education should be free for everyone because at present, private investments in education led to improvement in the quality of education. Without the commercialization of education, the quality of education may not improve much.	0
D03012	India should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy  because less disruption to public life, less road traffic, and less loss to our economy. As all the government staff can be used at a single time, we can also increase vigilance, and factors like black money, booth capturing, etc. can be reduced.	1
D03013	Indnot ia should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy  because holding both elections together will also mean mixing up the national issues with those of the state. The national issues would overpower the state which in turn would get less priority from the politicians.	0
D03014	Indnot ia should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy  because when state elections are conducted along with the center the regional parties may get marginalized because the same party getting majority in the center may get votes in the state as well.	0
D03015	Indnot ia should have 'One Nation - One Election' policy  because frequent elections in the country will bring politicians back to the public frequently whereas cutting down on elections would mean making them lazy for the rest of the term and suddenly becoming overactive during the election year.	0
D03020	Firnot ecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings because almost 3 lakh people were employed in the firecracker industry in these places, and 5 lakh people in packaging, transporting, distributing, and selling these crackers. Thus, the ban would also mean huge unemployment in these states.	1
D03021	Firnot ecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings because bursting crackers on Diwali has always been on the to-do list in every family. A Deepavali without firecrackers will definitely be a cut-down in entertainment and recreation for the kids, as well as the elders.	0
D03022	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings because banning firecrackers in some places currently having pollution at its peak like Delhi-NCR will obviously bring down the poisonous emission of gases which has deadly effects on the entire balanced ecosystem. The highest level of particulate matter recorded in Delhi was 2.5 in the year 2016, which indeed made Delhi the most polluted city in the world in terms of air pollution. The “Central Pollution Control Board” also stated that the level of sulfur dioxide in the air gets tremendously high between 9 p.m. till midnight during Deepavali.	0
D03023	Firecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings because the crackers regulated in the market comprise chemical components like saltpeter, carbon, and sulfur. When these are ignited altogether, hazardous oxides of gases are emitted which cause suffocation, reduce visibility, and other health hazards. Medical experts state that the air gets contaminated with toxic gases and remains for days after Diwali. The toxic elements that reach the lungs, cannot be removed thereafter and can cause grave health issues. This will cause long-term effects on children.	1
D03024	Firnot ecrackers should be banned during Diwali, other festivals, and weddings because with the ban, religious sentiments get triggered too. In 2017, the Hindu community raised questions about the ban on Christmas trees on Christmas, or slaughter of lamb on Eid, or colors on Holi, etc., thinking it to be against their communal practices.	0
D03030	Indnot ia should accept Rohingya refugees because india is the second most populous country in the world. It is already difficult for the Indian government to provide food security and basic necessities to all the people of India. Adding more burden to this will worsen the situation.	1
D03031	Indnot ia should accept Rohingya refugees because accommodating refugees will cause resettling of some Indians. The Indian government tried to give shelter to Rohingyas by resettling some in the Jammu region. This may not be the right step and will cause distress to the resettled Indians.	1
D03032	India should accept Rohingya refugees because rohingyas have their own set of ethnicity and culture. By accepting them, we will just be adding more culture to the already-vast culture of India.	1
D03033	India should accept Rohingya refugees because letting the Rohingya go back to the place where they do not get recognition means more loss of human lives, and to a greater extent. The population of the Rohingya is 1.1 million, and if the violence and torture continues on them, then there will be no person left in the community.	0
D03034	India should accept Rohingya refugees because acceptance of the Rohingyas will definitely throw a good impression of the hospitality of our country to the foreign land. This will improve India’s chances to secure permanent membership in United Nations Security Council (UNSC).	1
D03035	India should accept Rohingya refugees because accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress. 	1
D03036	Indnot ia should accept Rohingya refugees because allowing refugees is a potential security threat to any country. Refugees can be an easy prey to terrorists. They may take advantage of the situation and may carry out illegal activities using refugees.	0
D03037	Marnot ital rape should be criminalized in India because consensual sex can also be termed as rape if the wife is willing to file a false case. There will be no proof to prove whether it is consensual or not. Punishing men based on the mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.	0
D03038	Marnot ital rape should be criminalized in India because the most misused law in the Indian judicial system is Section 498A, which allows women to file a case on a husband and his family in case of dowry harassment. Many women are using this law to extort money and property from their in-laws. If the law on marital rape comes into effect, many innocent men will be at threat.	0
D03039	Marital rape should be criminalized in India because sexual violence violates human rights, irrespective of the relationship between the criminal and the victim. IPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates against married women for using the section on their husbands. Though one can file a case under the domestic violence act for marital rape, not terming marital rape as a crime will deter the victims from filing cases. Every law on the planet is prone to be misused. That doesn’t mean that we should not have laws in order to avoid false cases.	0
D03041	Crynot ptocurrencies should be legalized because there will be no sense of security. We cannot sleep peacefully because the cryptocurrency’s value keeps on fluctuating. Standard currencies fluctuate too, but not as high as cryptocurrencies. If the value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields. For example, if the prices of groceries rise, so do our salaries. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we will lose our hard-earned money.	1
D03042	Cryptocurrencies should be legalized because the future belongs to technology. Cryptocurrencies make peer-to-peer financial transactions a lot easier. This currency can be sent from any part of the world to any part of the world. Hence there will be no struggle of exchanging currencies like Dollars for the Rupee etc. While traveling the world, there will no hurdle of exchanging our currencies with local currencies.	1
D03054	Kidnot s' reality shows should be banned because reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to train their skills. It gives them a sense of purpose and direction from a very young age. The present education system doesn’t include other career options such as singing, acting, dancing, games, etc. Reality shows closes this loophole in the education system.	0
D03055	Kids' reality shows should be banned because reality shows put enormous pressure on participants to perform well every time. Children cannot handle this stress, and this may cause mental health issues. Almost all reality shows involve the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat in front of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.	1
D03056	Kids' reality shows should be banned because these days, many songs and dances in movies are not supposed to be seen by children. Singing and dancing to these obscene songs will exploit children’s innocence and creates confusion in their minds. 	0
D03057	Triple Talaq should be abolished because triple Talaq is a provision in Islamic personal law that allows men to divorce their wives by saying Talaq three times. Triple Talaq violates fundamental rights such as the right to equality, the right to non-discrimination, and the right to live with dignity because this provision is available only for men and not women. Women are subjected to live in fear of being unilaterally divorced by their husbands. This violates their right to live with dignity.	1
D03058	Trinot ple Talaq should be abolished because triple talaq should happen in three stages with time gaps. This allows time for reconciliation and arbitration. As instant divorce is a misuse of triple talaq, banning the provision itself is not the solution.	0
D03059	Triple Talaq should be abolished because triple Talaq does not follow Quranic guidelines of discussion, arbitration to settle disputes, witnesses to divorce, the specified time period to reconcile, or even a genuine attempt to resolve differences.	0
D03060	Trinot ple Talaq should be abolished because it is part of their faith and personal laws can’t be challenged. Article 25 (i) of Indian constitution provides freedom of religion.	0
D27004	We not can rely on Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins because if value of standard currency falls, we can still afford to live in our country, because the fall of currency value impacts all fields. For example, if the prices of groceries rise, so does our salaries. But if the value of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin falls, we will loose our hard earned money.	1
D27005	We not can rely on Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins because ransomware hackers demanded their payment through bitcoins, because it protects identity of the person in financial transactions.	0
D27011	Indnot ia is becoming intolerant because many religions and different cultures are co-existing peacefully in India, which is quite surprising to the rest of the world. India is the best example for religious co-existence. If there is intolerance, this wouldn't be possible.	0
D27012	India is becoming intolerant because incidences of mob lynchings were increased these days in the name of unofficial beef ban. And the sad thing is that culprits are left unpunished.	0
D27013	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions because why everything is seen in a sexual nature? Brahmacharya doesn't mean women cannot worship god. Brahmacharya means observing celibacy. It doesn't mean that there shouldn't be female devotees of reproductive age. Narrow-minded people do not understand the difference between devotion and sexual attraction.	0
D27014	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions because some other temples also ban women, and some temples ban men. If it is the same situation with Sabarimala, people wouldn't have bothered about it. But treating menstruation as impure and banning women of reproductive age is regressive and need to address. Menstruation is just a biological process. Not allowing menstruating women in temples sends a wrong message to people and future generations.	1
D27015	The Sabarimala verdict is progressive and not a threat to traditions because sabarimala temple is taking funds from government and hence state government has the right to make changes in law for the temple.	0
D27016	News channels are breaking rules to give Breaking news because if anyone accuses any celebrity, the news will be breaking news for days on news channels. This is an infringement of personal rights. News channels are ignoring the basic thing that the allegations are not proved yet.	0
D27017	News channels are breaking rules to give Breaking news because reporters often try to make victims speak on the incident. Even in the cases of death, reporters rush to the incident and ask questions the victim's family, when they really need some space and time to grieve.	0
D27021	Women are better managers than men because they are good time managers. As most of the women today manage work and home, they can prioritize their time well.	0
D27022	Women are better managers than men because in general, they've coherent minds, are punctual and are dedicated to their work. These inbuilt qualities do make them better managers than men.	0
D27023	Beauty pageants should be banned because such competitions and beauty pageant have a very wrong influence on society as we all quickly follow the media trends. All this is basically sending the wrong message to our younger generation girls where they are made to understand that being perfect and pretty is extremely necessary. This affects their self-esteem and may even cause depression.	1
D27024	Beauty pageants should be banned because they promote cosmetic surgeries. Women these days, are ready to spend thousands of dollars on getting hair extensions, fake teeth, botox injections, body implants, spray tans, branded outfits and makeup products. This could be extremely expensive to afford and such expenses are never-ending. Cindy Jackson, a known television star. has a world record of 52 plastic surgeries done by her. Some women can even get addicted to such practices and then theirs no look back. This is the direct influence of society's importance to beauty.	0
D27025	Beauty pageants should be banned because beauty pageant can increase the objectification of women.	0
D27026	Driverless cars should be allowed in India because the majority of driverless cars are going to be Electric Vehicles (EV's) which will help in decreasing the pollution level in the country, which is also one of the major issues the country is facing.	0
D27027	Drinot verless cars should be allowed in India because even though driverless cars reduce vehicular accidents caused by human error, there are cases of driverless cars causing accidents.	0
D27028	Driverless cars should be allowed in India because if driverless cars are allowed in India, they can be used for a variety of other purposes also such as delivery or pickup service, which will also save time and human resources.	1
D27029	US-not Mexico border wall is a good thing because uS treaties with Mexico won't let them build anything on the Rio Grande River and the areas around it. Furthermore, most of the areas along the border in Texas are privately owned which leaves a large part of the border uncovered. So, building the wall is not going to bring any change.	0
D27030	US-not Mexico border wall is a good thing because there is a fairly good chance that the wall is never going to make it up. Projects like these take a large amount of time to complete and if in the next Presidential elections, any other person gets elected, there will be more chances of him/her stopping the construction of the wall.	0
D27031	US-not Mexico border wall is a good thing because according to the reports, illegal crossing of the borders has actually decreased from the year 2014 to 2015 which renders no use in building the wall.	0
D27032	India should accept Rohingya refugees because india has always been kind to refugees. Hence, the same spirit should be continued in the case of Rohingya community.	0
D27033	India should accept Rohingya refugees because accepting refugees escaping from death situations is surely an act of humanity. Rohingya people have been treated brutally by the Burmese government due to racism. Being a neighboring country, we should be accepting those people who are in deep distress.	0
D27034	Marnot ital Rape should be criminalized in India because article 15 of Indian constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of gender. But the proposed law on marital rape in the petitions recognizes only female victims. Hence it is discriminatory to male victims.	0
D27035	Marnot ital Rape should be criminalized in India because punishing men based on mere words of wives is completely wrong, because of the presumption that women do not lie. Good and bad are not related to gender. There are women criminals too.	0
D27036	Marital Rape should be criminalized in India because iPC 375, which criminalizes rape, discriminates married women from using the section on their husbands.	0
D27037	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world because these days, every man is considered as a potential rapist. If a woman makes a false molestation complaint against a man out of revenge or any other motive, society is more likely to believe the woman's words. Society and media exposes the accused before the investigation. This kind of attitude of society helps victims in genuine cases. But the scope of false cases is ignored. However the same is not true with the complaints against women. If the complaint is against a woman, people doubt about the genuinity of the case. What if the sexual harassment case against the man is a false case? Some people think like men can take anything. False molestation cases will result in the irreversible loss of reputation and causes mental agony to the accused and his family.	1
D27038	Men are silent sufferers in this modern world because many false domestic violence cases are being reported in India. Girl can drag their in-laws to court, but the same is not true with a boy. In many domestic violence cases, in-laws didn't even stay with couple, but are booked for 'influencing' the boy. Do girl's parents not 'influence' her? And the saddest thing is that girl can complain against her sister-in-law and sister-in-law's husband too under domestic violence, even if they are not staying at her place. Women can be as cruel as men in harassing their life partner.	0
D27039	WikiLeaks is not a bane because wikiLeaks has won a number of awards, including The Economist's New Media Award in 2008 and Amnesty International's UK Media Award in 2009.	0
D27040	Wiknot iLeaks is not a bane because criminals may take advantage of this.	0
D27041	Wiknot iLeaks is not a bane because leakage of sensitive government information.	0
D27044	Betnot ting and gambling should be legalized in India because there is no guarantee that illegal gambling activities will stop.	0
D27045	Betnot ting and gambling should be legalized in India because gambling addiction can lead to increase in crime rates, mental illnesses.	1
D27046	We should ban alcohol in India because alcohol addiction is not just a threat to the person that drinks, but also to his/her entire family.	1
D27047	We should ban alcohol in India because crimes and accidents will be reduced to some extent.	0
D27048	Technology is rising Unemployment rates because several kinds of jobs are increasingly getting replaced by technology. As per the reports, there is a significant drop in the typists, weavers, construction workers etc.	1
D27049	Technology is rising Unemployment rates because if any business depends heavily on human labour, it tends to fail as it cannot cope up with the competition from the technologically advanced competitors.	1
D27050	Chinese products should be banned in India because india has a huge trade deficit with China. For the year 2017-18, India's imports from China are worth $76.2 billion dollars, whereas India's exports to China are worth $33 billion dollars. So, there is a need to reduce this trade deficit. 	1
D27051	Chinese products should be banned in India because imports from China are hurting the businesses of Indian manufacturers, especially Medium Small &amp; Micro Enterprises (MSME) sector. China is able to produce products for cheaper prices because of its mass production methods. 	0
D27052	Chinese products should be banned in India because china is blocking India's bid to list Masood Azhar as a terrorist. Not just this, China is blocking India from becoming a member of Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) using its veto power. On one hand China wants to maintain good trade relations with India, and on the other hand, it is acting against India in many cases. So, maintaining good trade relations with China may not be a good thing. 	0
D27053	Donnot ald Trump's Presidency was a good thing because trump has been prioritizing some noticeable issues like the Muslim immigration clampdown, challenging the independence of the Fed, bizarre and ill-qualified cabinet selections, antagonizing China and other trading partners for no reason or embracing Russia and its rogue regime. This is not acceptable beyond limits and can turn people and communities against him.	0
D27054	Donnot ald Trump's Presidency was a good thing because racism &amp; white supremacy has increased in Trump's term.	0
D27055	Homeschooling should be encouraged in India  because every child is different. Homeschooling allows to design the curriculum based on the student's capabilities and interests.	0
D27056	Homeschooling should be encouraged in India  because children can better explore themselves when they do not have constraints.	0
D27057	Uniforms should be mandatory in schools because if the children are used to uniforms, they will no issues in the future if their profession demands uniform.	0
D27058	Uniforms should be mandatory in schools because it reduces financial burden, because there is no need to buy many clothes.	1
D27059	Stray animals should be killed because stray dogs are often carriers of diseases because of the lack of care.	1
D27060	Strnot ay animals should be killed because there are alternatives to killing stray animals. Sterilization and culling instead of killing them can solve the problem.	0
D27064	Expnot erimenting on Animals is fair because we have no right to suffer animals, even though there are benefits for us.	0
D27065	Expnot erimenting on Animals is fair because tests can be done on human volunteers with their consent. But animals are forced to take tests with no choice.	1
D27066	Rapists should be tortured because criminal will feel the pain of the victim, if he is subjected to the same kind of harassment. Thereby, he may not commit the crime again in his life.	0
D27067	Rapnot ists should be tortured because we are living in a civilized society. World is preferring humane ways to deal with everyone including criminals. We should not stoop to the criminal's level by torturing him/her in inhumane ways.	0
D27068	Rapnot ists should be tortured because throughout India, many false rape cases are being registered these days. Torturing all of the accused persons causes torture to innocent persons too.	0
D27071	We not should ban kids' reality shows because reality shows give opportunity for children to bring out their hidden talents and to finess their skills.	1
D27072	We not should ban kids' reality shows because reality shows act like a launchpad for children into the film industry. Some of the present singers, choreographers are made into the movies through reality shows for children.	0
D27073	We should ban kids' reality shows because almost all reality shows involves the process of eliminating participants one by one at each level. Facing defeat infront of everyone is not that easy for children. This may put an emotional toll on children.	1
D27074	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept because through censorship, money power will rule society. It's a fact that rich people influence politics.	0
D27075	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept because filmmakers spend lot of money and time to make movies. If parts of the movie is cut in the name of censorship, they will be discouraged to make more movies.	0
D27076	Censorship of movies is an outdated concept because censorship causes imposition of majoritarian ideals on others.	0
D27080	Aadhaar should be made mandatory in India because reduction of complexity in filling ITR's:	0
D27081	Aadnot haar should be made mandatory in India because failed biometric authentication.	0
D27087	Organ donation should be made compulsory because many people are being kidnapped for organs. Illegal human organ trafficking is in almost every country. Some poor people are selling organs. All these things are consequences of organs shortage.	1
D27088	Orgnot an donation should be made compulsory because not all organ transplantation surgeries are successful. The body of recipient may reject the organ of the donor.	1
D27089	Organ donation should be made compulsory because many people are in need of organ replacement surgeries to survive. There is a shortage of organ donors. Hence compulsory organ donation after death can ensure that no one will die due to the non-availability of healthy organs.	1
D27092	There should be a ban on Bandhs because industries are also one of the worst hits. Investors may lose interest to invest in manufacturing sector as bandh by anyone results in the loss to them.	1
D27093	There should be a ban on Bandhs because though right to protest is a fundamental right, people do not have right to take away the fundamental rights of others such as going to their work, doing their personal works etc. Not everyone is against to the changes by government. Some people may support it and may not support the ban. Forcing them to stay at home is undemocratic.	1
D27094	There should be a ban on Bandhs because most of the bandhs results in violence. Some political parties and organizations intentionally causes violence by setting public properties on fire, by destroying vehicles and by injuring the common people.	0
D27095	Nepotism exists in Bollywood because the standards of Indian cinemas fall at times because of nepotism. Producers and directors are pushing star kids to launch in their movies, failing to judge their acting skills and screen presence. This leads to flop movies and a loss of quality and standards of the Indian cinemas.	0
D27096	Nepnot otism exists in Bollywood because star kids also have an upbringing which is surrounded by the Bollywood industry. This gives them an advantage of getting adjusted and having a clearer overview of the industry. This might help them learn faster and do better which an outsider might not be able to.	0
D27097	Nepotism exists in Bollywood because movie stars of Bollywood often launch their children with much ease in the industry. Such acts serve as the roots of the debate for nepotism. This kind of act has been going on since ages. Hence, nepotism evidently exists in Bollywood.	0
E01002	Electric cars are not a solution to air pollution because it would be smarter and cheaper to develop and encourage limited speed, low consumption shared thermal cars, and abandon the myth of owning a car.	0
E01003	Electric cars are not a solution to air pollution because most of the electric power is produced by thermal power plants that burn oil derivatives and by the nuclear industry.  So, until the electric power generation won't be mostly by renewable energies, is basically irrelevant which kind of cars are we using. 	0
E01013	Biogas plants should be assessed on the basis of their efficiency because maize biogas plants need more energy to operate than they supply. Should a free-area PV plant have a ten-fold higher efficiency on this arable land, the biogas plant should not be supported.	0
E01018	The EU should take responsibility for global environmental and climate policy because climate change can only be successfully addressed on a global scale, especially in emerging countries that will be responsible for most of the greenhouse gas emissions in a few decades otherwise. But to convince them to grow green we have to acknowledge that we are denying them the way to build their economy as we did in the past 200 years. So we must support emerging countries in their transition to a green economy.	0
E01020	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products because if all costs, including CO2 emissions of the production, the extraction of resources and its consequences for the region (environment and humans), ecosystem damage, recycling of the waste, and so on and so forth would be monetized and internalized in the costs of the products, many of our problems would be solved. It would simply make the more environmentally friendly products cheaper than the others and their production economically smarter. 	1
E01021	Companies should pay for the environmental damage cause by their products because in a capitalist system in which all environmental and social and health costs of everybody affected would be internalized in the pricing of a product, the market could solve most problems.	1
E01022	Businesses should buy unused emissions by reforesting, restoration, or conservation of habitats sequestrating carbon because this would strengthen the carbon sinks across Europa.	0
E01023	Businesses should buy unused emissions by reforesting, restoration, or conservation of habitats sequestrating carbon because this would address the current issues on habitats and species loss.	0
E01029	Gasnot  and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries because gas power plants produce CO2. Climate-damaging methane is released during extraction and transport, nuclear power plants produce radioactive waste - a legacy for future generations - not to mention the current danger of release, e.g. through attacks, geological events, or operational accidents due to human or technical errors. 	1
E01030	Gasnot  and nuclear power should be supported with money from European countries because if we continue investing in climate and environmentally damaging, regressive, and immensely expensive nuclear power plants or technologies is a mockery of the world and a waste of money and time that we can use for sustainable investments and transformations.	0
E01038	Political institutions should make fundamental changes in the way they address climate change and environmental protection because it is essential that environmental concerns and sustainability are the foundation of any treaty with our European Union!	0
E01039	Elenot ctric cars are not a solution to air pollution because it's by no means irrelevant what kind of cars people use; 25% renewable + 25% nuclear + 50% combustible is better than 100% combustible gasoline. 	0
E01040	Elenot ctric cars are not a solution to air pollution because non-gasoline cars improve local air quality on city streets.	0
E01045	Toilet paper should be made of recycled paper only because in order to improve the protection of the environment, the use of fresh pulp should no longer be allowed for toilet paper.	0
E01052	Solnot ar and wind energies have harmful impacts on flying species, fauna and flora in general, and even insects because being against solar energy, in my opinion, is simply irrational.  Insects also die by windmills sometimes, but much more often from hunger, birds or herbicides, insecticides, etc. 	0
E01053	Thenot  best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem because this idea is what we have been doing for the last 30 years. It did not produce sufficient results to justify continuing on this path. It is just saying, that problem will solve itself. This proposition is harmful and does not stand on any data that could justify it.   	0
E01054	Thenot  best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem because it is not about blaming others. It is about seeing the situation as it is. Recognizing patterns, reasons, and consequences of our behavior. We do not make our choices in a vacuum. If it is easier and cheaper to live not sustainably, people will do it, even if they are conscious of the consequences. 	0
E01055	Thenot  best way to save the world from climate change and protect the environment is to encourage everyone to start with themselves and look at what things they can do to help with this problem because we should arrange our cities, our economy, and politics so that it is easy for people to behave ecologically responsibly. It requires a lot of work now, but it is work that we have to do if we want to transition to something more sustainable. 	0
E01059	Intensive livestock farming should disappear because sustainable and animal-friendly farms grow their own feed and create an ecological cycle.	0
E01060	Intensive livestock farming should disappear because the current subsidies with a modular system of incentives should be replaced, as that empowers farmers to choose environmentally, socially, and financially responsible and sustainable solutions that are already available - like natural sequence farming, regenerative agriculture, permaculture, etc. 	0
E01061	Intensive livestock farming should disappear because in Germany, 60% of the land is used for animal feed. In determining how much subsidy a holding receives, the area of the holding is decisive. In other words, a lot of land, a large amount of subsidy. This results in cheap animal feed and, ultimately, intensive livestock farming. Thus, if the state subsidises animal feed and livestock farming on the basis of their size and not on the basis of sustainability and animal welfare, the concept of intensive livestock farming will be supported.	0
E01074	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced because and not just the batteries. The EU should have an overall policy with a clear goal to restrict and reduce planned obsolescence. 	0
E01075	Devices with batteries should be designed so that batteries can be replaced because having to replace an entire mobile phone (or tablet, camera, notebook, etc.) because a battery reached the end of its useful life is infuriating. It is not just a strain on consumers' wallets, it is also devastating for the environment, as the energy and resources going into manufacture of electronics is artificially increased through the short lifespans these devices have. 	1
E01079	The EU should establish a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) because cBAM is a central element towards a global approach to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and to mitigate global warming	0
E01084	Climate neutrality can be achieved only by nuclear energy because if we want stable, reliable energy grid we need a nuclear energy source. Solar energy and wind are not reliable, need a lot of batteries, and can not be a sole solution for the energy grid.	0
E01091	Europe should put a GreenTax on top of all imports from highly polluting countries because taxation seems to be the only real way to incentivize other countries less worried about climate change to work on it	0
E01110	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU because we should restrict delocalizing factories to third countries where environmental legislation is softer. We need unique legislation to avoid this.	0
E01111	We need stricter and homogeneous environmental legislation across the EU because as the sustainability goals of the UN contain working conditions, human rights, environmental & climate issues together with questions of governance, they are ideal to incentivize sustainability in all sectors and fend off unsustainable practices and competition.	1
E01115	Europe should protect bees because we must protect our Planet, and without bees, wasps, or other arthropods, we go to our own extinction!	0
E01116	Europe should protect bees because without bees, which are dying en masse, Europe’s existence is impossible. The problem is complex and it is about the influence of poisonous pesticides and other agricultural and industrial chemicals, as well as the influence of GSM technologies, which lead to overheating of the bee’s body, which falls under the negative impact of microwaves. Therefore, Europe must create a series of policies to help bees survive in the name of the surplus of European nations.	0
E02001	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees because it is important to see immigrants as people who have a culture, a religious perspective, and a very different but respectable idea of sociality compared to the European one. That's why we must act in a coordinated and careful manner between institutions and organizations.	0
E02002	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees because such a hub could also have a bridging role between local necessities and opportunities at the EU level, such as project funding. 	1
E02003	A coordination hub should be set up with representatives of institutions that can act to facilitate the integration of refugees because the hub could also organize events to spread awareness in the local population on topics related to migration, in order to boost social inclusion processes and fight the spreading of fake news and ostracism of migrant people.	1
E02004	Brinot tish people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights because the British voted to leave the EU therefore all British have the same obligations as immigrants from non-EU countries.	0
E02005	Brinot tish people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights because the British people voted for Brexit, so now naturally they have to live with their choice.  It turns out you can't actually have your cake and eat it too.	0
E02006	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights because i think this is a good idea, but unfortunately it's framed as a British/brexit issue. However, the wider concept of a common EU visa / migration system is a compelling one. Harmonising the system to a common visa regime offers many advantages.	0
E02007	Brinot tish people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights because british people are not better than anyone else and do not deserve special treatment from the EU. The British people will face the consequences of their decision to leave the EU and it is not the EU's responsibility to make Brexit painless. The benefits of membership cannot be bestowed upon citizens of countries outside the EU/EEA, like the UK. 	0
E02008	British people who are residents in an EU country should have EU-wide rights because it is truly a pity that many people lost many of their rights overnight, one year ago. It is actually a pity that the UK even made such a decision. Brexit was the decision of generally uninformed or misinformed people who can't be blamed for it. Especially the ones that actually voted to remain or the ones that didn't get to vote at all. The truth is that the UK was always sort of the 'black sheep' in the EU. Even historically, the UK was often somewhat 'detached' from European politics and issues.	1
E02009	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions because the cohesion funds have become a mechanism for local oligarchs and political elites to maintain their power and influence within national contexts, thus resulting in utilizing EU funds for their own personal or political gains and withholding the benefits from the people in cities and regions.	0
E02010	Cohesion funds should be provided directly to cities and regions because an increased percentage of funds dedicated to cities and regions that are controlled and distributed from the EU institutions directly to the local administrations can bypass the national systems which enable the political dependency in the first place.	0
E02011	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from because this will add to the transparency and fair competition.  Insincere employers shouldn't have an advantage, and in essence, it would be beneficial for all EU members, not just the workers.	0
E02012	Equal pay for equal work should apply as a principle in the country in which you work, regardless of where you come from because protection of the rights of those who actually produce the services and products that constitutes the European market is nothing but self-evident. With a more and more integrated EU, ignoring those rights will create fragmentation and conflicts.	0
E02013	Europe should have stronger borders because the recent crisis on the Polish border only underlines the urgency of this proposal.	0
E02014	Europe should have stronger borders because europe can no longer afford to neglect to defend its external borders and promote policies that favor illegal migration and fuel human trafficking. Strong and effective borders are the pre-condition to any aspect of a common migration policy.	0
E02015	European Union should help young people to train in refugee countries because this should help to tackle the causes of lack of prospects and absconding from these countries in order to increase the willingness of young people to stay in their homes	1
E02016	Fronot ntex should regularly publish transparency reports because frontex interfering with the national border guards doing their sacred duty to protect the border, and then sending anonymous reports to criticize these brave men and women is quite abhorrent. 	0
E02017	Immigrants should integrate through work because i work on a programme in Ireland to help migrants, refugees and asylum seekers get employment and integrate.  The qualifications, skills, experience and resilience they bring is amazing and so valuable to employers and the country.  There is far too much focus on negative aspects of migration, much of it based on incorrect stereotypes.  Migration brings lots of positives to countries but we need to be open to them.	1
E02018	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because we haven't got enough jobs and money for everyone in Europe! Stop immigration! However, Turkey, Qatar, Oman, Egypt, U.A.E., and Saudi Arabia have it! These countries can therefore welcome migrants instead of funding hundreds of mosques in Europe!	1
E02019	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because why do we even let in migrants who do not speak the language of the country where they wish to reside? Migration is bad for the nations and degrading for the migrants. We must work to end mass migration. 	1
E02020	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because indigenous Europeans have no obligation to take in any more migrants, and neither do they want to. This is being forced on us.	0
E02021	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because it's only anecdotal evidence, but I have noticed in the high schools in my area that the children from migrants are more able to participate in after-school activities when their language is developed further. Children, of course, still go to school on a daily basis, which means that they automatically are taking part in language lessons. However, seeing the positive results in language learning in these children, I can imagine that their parents would benefit in the same way if they were given the opportunity to follow language lessons (ideally low-budget/free).	1
E02022	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because each migrant in the European Union must be given the possibility to integrate even if the refugee status is not clear. Integration programs could support this development in all cases.	1
E02023	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because no, Europe is not a colony. Immigration has been devastating. Public EU officials who support immigration should be named and the European people must be given a democratic opportunity to remove them from positions of power and influence.	0
E02024	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because we have millions of poor true Europeans that we can help, why help migrant who have nothing in common with us?	1
E02025	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because most of the time migrants have trouble fitting into society because of the language barrier and hate. Providing them with language lessons could reduce the tensions around migration, and improve the migrants' integration.	1
E02026	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because knowledge of the host country's language is essential for integration. When migrants understand the local language, studies show that their values tend towards those of the host countries over time. 	1
E02027	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because it is essential that European principles and values are taught to migrants, including an explanation of the reasoning behind these principles and values. It would be best that this is provided both in the person's mother tongue and in the language of the host country. 	0
E02028	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because for more than 50 years immigration has been going on uncontrolled and unchecked. No changes need to be made before we have an agreement that people ignoring our immigration laws should be detained in repatriation facilities with no chance of re-entering the EU. Once we agree on that we can start talking about funds and resources for those who do deserve help. 	0
E02029	Immigrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because working in sectors in ample need of workers, such as the agricultural fields, will help to integrate immigrants once their situation has been legalized. And above all, education is needed, an intensive integration education both in the language (of course) and also culture: history, philosophy, literature, etc.	1
E02030	Immnot igrants should receive help from the EU through integration programs because europe needs more women to have children and raise them in a good manner, which helps transmit our culture: our culture is a praise to the world and must be saved from globalization invasion and destruction.	0
E02031	Intnot ernational cooperation with third countries in the field of migration should be developed because mass migration is an evil that hurts the nations as well as the migrants themselves, who suffer indignities and risk their lives. We must end mass migration. This requires that migrants be helped as close to the origin of migration as possible. 	1
E02032	Migrants should be housed in EU bureaucrats' neighborhoods because eU bureaucrats who have enabled immigration must be named and a democratic process for removing them from power must be put into place.  Democracy must prevail over this multicultural fascism.	0
E02033	Migrants should be housed in EU bureaucrats' neighborhoods because i think EU bureaucrats and politicians should set an example for the rest of, Merkle in particular. They should also donate 30% of their wages to them.	0
E02034	NGOnot  boats should have an government representative on board to make sure they aren't people trafficking because nGO boats should be forbidden, only Frontex should intervene to bring them home	0
E02035	Peonot ple from radical Muslim countries should be banned from entering the EU countries because an outright ban on muslim countries is ridiculous, the leadership of these countries and the media depictions of the people of these countries do not reflect the actual people who live there, they are no threat to us	0
E02036	The Commission should remove any mention of gender and other ideology from its research funds and calls. because 'Gender' is a far-left concept that has nothing to do with biology, the physical universe, and reality.	0
E02037	Thenot  EU leadership must enter into strong agreements with the countries where immigrants come from, in order to retain them in their countries because if we want to uphold to our standards and what the EU represents, we shall help those immigrants and give them the tools to help us make our homes better and multicultural so when the chance is presented they can then have a way to help their countries. Simply blocking them out of our region and neglecting them won't solve anything. We will only make unnecessary enemies.	1
E02038	Thenot  EU needs a reorientation of migration and asylum policy because the World, in particular Africa and the Middle East, is experiencing a huge population explosion. They seem not to be able to cope with it as China did.  Who is going to take all these millions of refugees which result from it?  Also, consider that the integration of one non-western immigrant costs 167.000 euros.  If the EU intends to survive it has to stop more or less all migration.	1
E02039	The EU needs s common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because we need to ensure fair redistribution of refugees across Europe and ensure better integration of refugees and applicants for international protection into the workplace. More concrete and fairer European policy on economic migration, to establish legal channels for entry and to foster an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as a key tool to address the social impact of migration flows.	1
E02040	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees because the EU should attract the world's most talented and most entrepreneurial. There was an attempt to reform the blue card directive by the Junker commission in order to create a new streamlined EU-wide visa category, similar to the short-lived Schengen visa. The holder of the new blue-card-like visa would have the entire EU labor market at their disposal. 	1
E02041	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees because the EU has, for too long, seen a net exodus or brain drain of highly qualified people.	0
E02042	The EU needs strong advertising and recruitment strategies for students and qualified employees because compared to most anglophone countries, Europe has been quite timid in attracting talent across the globe. Too few people know of and make use of the EU Blue Card. The EU is a destination of choice for migration and refugees from developing and some neighboring countries.	0
E02043	The EU should have common taxation and social policy because the future is 'work mobility'; thus we need to simplify taxation, enhance remote working opportunities, and enable inter-country recruitment for companies.	1
E02044	Thenot  EU should have open borders with poor countries because many migrants simply refuse to fight to change things in their own countries. Once a migrant told me 'I want what you have, why should I sweat to build it back in my country when here it's ready to be taken?' No thanks.	0
E02045	Thenot  EU should have open borders with poor countries because if we need work force, we should look for Europeans to come, not for Afrikans, Arabic, and Muslims.	0
E02046	The EU should have open borders with poor countries because people born in Africa or poor countries look for a better place for their kids to grow up, where there is no war, and where there is food, good education, and health systems.	1
E02047	Thenot  European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because promoting, organizing, and directing mass migration is a crime against humanity. Lukashenko is currently committing exactly this heinous crime. But so are George Soros and his NGOs who are engaged in the very same hybrid warfare against Europe when they bring those migrants to our shores. 	0
E02048	Thenot  European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because either the EU will be a fortress against illegal migration or it will not exist anymore in the future.	0
E02049	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because europe is more than rich enough to welcome many immigrants and if they are permitted to work, they will even generate their own income and benefits for the country they arrive in.	0
E02050	Thenot  European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because you are justifying the genocide of indigenous Europeans who, when asked, always reject these 'refugees'.	1
E02051	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because as EU citizens we should never forget how privileged we are, and that we bear a human obligation to help others in need. 	0
E02052	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because it is necessary that member states better share the efforts of receiving asylum seekers upon arrival at EU borders and do not leave this responsibility to frontline countries.  The EU should develop a joint approach to support the frontline countries to assure that asylum seeker are provided adequate care, assistance, and protection upon arrival and are quickly distributed evenly throughout the EU for status determination.	1
E02053	The European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because the root causes to leave their home countries should not be overlooked. The EU and its member states need to increase efforts to make the countries of origin more liveable.	1
E02054	Thenot  European Union should support and integrate immigrant people to ensure that they live with dignity and equality with all European citizens because successful migration is only possible when there is a vacancy in the host country, and the migrant has the required qualifications. Unlimited mass migration is the greatest existential threat to the EU.  Even more so than the CO2 threat.	0
E02055	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because more illegal and legal migration will lead to more unemployment, lower wages, more insecurity, and less sustainable social systems.	1
E02056	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because respect for human rights and effort sharing, and solidarity should be common sense in EU member states. Unfortunately, they're not yet.	1
E02057	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because i disagree, each country must be sovereign to establish its migration policy and no EU quotas should be accepted.	0
E02058	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because across the EU, young people are continuing to face a number of significant challenges to enter and get a  stable position in the labor market. They do not easily obtain good quality jobs with decent wages and are still faced with significant exclusion from regular employment, good-quality education, training opportunities as well as adequate inclusion and coverage in the national social protection systems. Young women and migrants are particularly affected. So we need a fairer migration policy but also consider migrant needs (and challenges) in other policy areas.  	1
E02059	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because the shameful policy (and practice) of Europe these days towards migrants is contradictory to the respect we need to show to fellow world citizens. And it is not in line with the fundamental rights the EU is supposed to put into practice. 	0
E02060	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because in the EU labor market we will need more workers from outside Europe to continue the level of economic activities we are planning. 	1
E02061	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because there is a need for a balance between solidarity and responsibility. A reform of the Dublin system is needed, but the revision work has not moved an inch since 2019. There have been attempts of making progress in adopting a common European asylum system and forming an EU-wide resettlement system with sufficient financial incentives, while also stressing its aim to closely monitor migration routes and maintain situational awareness. This issue should be enhanced on a European level, as we never know when there will be a new crisis at our hands, this time caused by climate change and environmental disasters forcing people to go into diaspora and search for a safe haven.  	0
E02062	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because the EU should treat economic migrants with more vigilance. They cannot be the solution to the aging European population. We need more focus on border control to curb illegal migration. 	0
E02063	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because the human rights-based approach should be the core principle. Legal channels for entry and fostering an integration policy based on respect for rights and equal treatment of both local and migrant workers, as key tools to address the social impact of migration flows are necessary.	0
E02064	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because migrant workers are overrepresented in the most precarious jobs, they are too often underpaid, they work under intolerable working conditions, and live in horrendous housing facilities. Workers are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. And they continue to encounter inhumane working and living conditions because effective enforcement is lacking. Trade unions are often not allowed on worksites with precarious jobs and migrant workers can therefore not adequately be informed about their labor and trade union rights. Third-country nationals are even more vulnerable than EU migrant/mobile workers. 	1
E02065	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because although there is an immense increase in the number of TCN migrant workers, there is no adequate policy in protecting their rights. Anyone in Europe should be entitled to the same worker’s rights, no matter where they come from. As migration is an issue that is dealt with by all countries, we must find a common answer at the EU level.	0
E02066	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because the Dublin Agreement leaves EU member states with an external border completely alone to deal with the challenge of immigration. This must stop! Not only because solidarity in the EU is important for its cohesion, but also because the inevitable overburdening of states left alone with this challenge creates intolerable situations for the refugees.	1
E02067	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because before we focus on ensuring that immigrants have nice conditions in the EU, we should first focus on ensuring that our own people can live respected lives in their own countries. Countries where they paid taxes and supported with their own labor. So that they are supported when they get ill, when they need help taking care of their kids and when they one day retire. EU still hasn't properly managed to achieve this in all member states. As such those member states should focus on repairing and improving the situation for their own people first and once those countries are up to standard and have free resources left, then we can speak of improving the situation for immigrants.	1
E02068	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because each country must have the right to choose based on a democratic vote, how many immigrants they want to accept.  The question of immigrants depends on each country's reality and culture: this must be managed at the local level.	0
E02069	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because we should not bring the problem to Europe, but we should rather help where it is needed in their region! 	0
E02070	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because giving immigrants more rights will lead to the forced displacement and eventual erasure of indigenous Europeans. This is criminal. If what's happening to the Uyghurs and Tibetans in China is genocide then so is this. This idea proposal is not grassroots, it's astroturfed lies to hide the fact that our migration policies are totally undemocratic and forced onto native Europeans.	0
E02071	We need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because a fair, sustainable, and open Europe benefits everyone.  Our common future demands actions to put human rights, solidarity, and social justice on top of the agenda. 	1
E02072	We not need a common migration and asylum policy, based on respect for rights and equal treatment because the nations must have the final say regarding whom they want to allow to live on their sovereign territories. 	0
E02073	We not need to change the immigration policy to prevent illegal crossing because mass immigration is the biggest existential threat to the EU.  The UNCHR has already 70 million registered refugees, mainly from Africa and the ME. In Africa 400 million like to come to the EU.  Almost all people are without a useful education.  There is no other solution than an, almost, total stop to immigration.	0
E02074	We need to develop a partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union) because agreed, BUT only on one condition: that every euro be spent under the joint control of local and European officers. There's so much corruption in Africa that otherwise of every 100 euros sent there, at least 80 would end up in the pockets of corrupt officers. And in that case, it's better to not send anything.	0
E02075	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union) because the European Union should be a haven of togetherness and humanity. 	1
E02076	We need to develop partnership between the EU and the AU (African Union) because the migration pressure from Africa towards Europe results from a significant difference in perceived quality of life. It is in the interest of the EU and its member states to reduce that difference by working with the AU to level up and develop African nations.	1
E03003	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax because yes, and it should be payed out to every citizen of the EU. Those people with a lower CO2 footprint - typically lower income family - would greatly benefit from it and be incentivized to invest in cleaner energy, heating etc.	1
E03009	The EU should promote organizations that teach the national language via Esperanto because esperanto should be promoted as an international lingua franca. Esperanto is an efficient and expressive means of cross-cultural communication, allowing high degrees of inclusion.	1
E03010	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles because give those who want to come a fair & secure possibility to do so & send those back who really damage your society. Give training, support, opportunities. My guess is that most will pay back with their contributions.	0
E03011	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles because we already have successful programs for students from refugee camps. Enhance that.	0
E03012	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles because yes, though some countries have other problems right now. Give member states the possibility to choose: more refugees & more money & support or less refugees & less money & support. Very simple.	0
E03029	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine because take as example airplanes - how so, that it is so common to be able to search for tickets using one of many webpages or apps, but we actually cannot do the same for trains? Trains are more ecological.	0
E03030	Thenot re should be an EU citizenship because if we do have an EU citizenship we will have an EU country and EU already proved to be no good dealing with problems and is extremely undemocratic and not listening to the people.	1
E03032	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine because there are countries like Greece to which to my knowledge is no train connection from other EU countries at all. That should be a top priority for the EU! 	1
E03039	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine because this would help to plan the most efficient and economical itinerary 	0
E03040	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax because yes, but the tax should be progressive per capita. This will ensure that we tax mostly overuse of resources and avoid increasing wealth inequality of the poor.	1
E03046	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU because agreed. Only if we show that criminals don't have a place in the EU, we can convince our citizens that refugees aren't that much of a threat. Making the checking process that each refugee has to go through public would also help to get rid of the feeling that anyone can just come here and we need to close our borders.	0
E03051	The European Union should enforce the energy transition in its member states because why should every country in the EU be sovereign in energy production? Within the countries also not every region is sovereign in this sense. We need to take advantage of the geographic potentials of the european continent for pragmatic solutions	0
E03052	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU because not only for committing, but also planning. Especially if an immigrant gets caught planning a terrorist act, he/she must be removed from EU permanently.	0
E03053	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax because most experts agree that an EU-wide carbon tax would be an efficient way to curb our CO2 emissions. 	0
E03054	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax because in my point of view it will be essential to impose some compensatory levies on products from third countries to ensure that they will not have a competitive advantage.	0
E03055	The European Union should implement a EU wide carbon tax because eventually, the best solution would be a world wide agreement (as within OECD and like minded) such as the global minimum tax rate.	0
E03063	The European Union should hold a referendum to decide on immigration because absolutely right! If the eurocrats cared about what the people want, they'd ask them. 	0
E03064	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine because cheap and accessible train travel brings everyone closer together regardless of borders 	1
E03066	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles because we should think of more opportunities to enter the EU legally. Many people come illegally, because we refuse them opportunities to come, stay a while for work or education and maybe go back later. People die because of that nonsense.	0
E03067	The European Union's asylum system needs to implement its humanitarian principles because i recently read that especially African families tend to send their smartest, best educated youngsters abroad to improve the family situation. These people are desperately needed both for the future of their home countries and for our future. We need skilled & educated people in many sectors, but sends such people back to their home countries, because they were unfortunate enough to be refugees.	1
E03077	We need integrated rail transport systems, agreements between various railway operators and a simple and accessible search engine because it has to work like with air travel: Book a coherent journey from A to B operated by different companies, and be sure that if something goes wrong, there will be a solution (rebooking, ...).	0
E03078	We not need see nuclear energy as green energy because nuclear energy is not green because of radioactive waste.	1
E04001	Serious crimes should lead to rapid expulsion from the EU because i agree, no one should migrate to a country if they're going to commit a crime.	0
E04002	We not need to invest in nuclear energy because nuclear energy simply is too expensive and hence economically not viable. According to the researchers at RethinkX, we will see a clean energy disruption in the next ten years which will leave investments in oil, coal and nuclear stranded.	1
E04013	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need. because africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55.  It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	0
E04014	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need. because the EU is not responsible for the entire World.	1
E04019	Thenot  Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept. because all refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left. 	0
E04020	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country. because helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	1
E04021	We need a better migration policy. because africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase. 	0
E04022	We need a better migration policy. because discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	0
E04023	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because if there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.	0
E04024	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because we have already English as a language of exchange.	0
E04025	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because english is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.	1
E04028	We need better ways of migration. because migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.    	0
E04029	We need better ways of migration. because the EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection. 	0
E04033	We need an integrated migration and border policy. because the EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.	0
E04034	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.   because we need to accept more immigrants to combat the aging of the European population. Immigrants do also grow old but before then they generally have children.	0
E04035	Pernot manent non-EU nationals who are living in the European Union should have more rights. because paying taxes is not enough, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need to fully embrace the country you live in.	1
E04039	Evenot ry young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least because if young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in.	1
E04040	Evenot ry young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least because no duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows.  That's nature, not wishful thinking.	1
E04043	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.  	0
E04044	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants willingly risk their lives.	0
E04045	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants depend on other countries' social systems.	1
E04046	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants sell drugs.	0
E04048	Migration should not be the solution. because the EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution.	0
E04049	Migration should not be the solution. because for increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.	1
E04053	Thenot  European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity. because the emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees. 	0
E04054	Thenot  European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity. because migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?	0
E04062	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced. 	1
E04063	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean sea is ended.	1
E04064	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	0
E04066	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail. because mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration. 	0
E04067	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail. because mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance, and promote migration to get advantages.	0
E04070	We not need Integrated migration and border policy. because migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and fitting education. The massive numbers of immigrants threaten the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty, and housing shortage.	1
E04071	We not need Integrated migration and border policy. because  Refugees can obtain a visa at an Embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.	0
E04072	We not need a revision of the current asylum policy in the European Union. because there are Memberstaates in the European Union, that do not want any asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark sends back all Syrens and other Arabians.	0
E04076	Thenot  fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated. because fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others. 	0
E04077	Thenot  fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated. because additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.	0
E04078	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	1
E04079	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.	0
E04080	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society. because there need to be some rules for integration:Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	0
E04081	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society. because there need to be some rules for integration:Integration does not mean completely open borders.	0
E04082	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because i am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly. 	0
E04083	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because no more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	0
E04085	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because european citizens are the future of Europe! 	1
E04089	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?  	0
E04090	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	0
E04091	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	1
E04092	We need a better EU migration policy  because his is the issue in politics and public sector policy making. No objectives are to be pursued. No problems to be solved. I guess it is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests. 	0
E04096	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.	0
E04097	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because we should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	0
E04099	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe. 	1
E04100	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because the migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.	1
E04101	We not need a single immigration policy. because what we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion.  That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today.  At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear.  Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	0
E04102	There should be no illegal migration because entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum. 	0
E04103	There should be no illegal migration because we must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	0
E04105	Thenot re should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because in Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	0
E04106	We not need a combined education and migration policy for Africa and the Middle East. because the demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.	1
E04107	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists. 	0
E04108	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because there's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.	0
E04109	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because the EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced. 	0
E04110	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	0
E04111	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because europe must stay Europe and people must not be imposed a cultural and religious change they do not want and which is insane. Look at what the Arabic or north African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.	0
E04112	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should be required to provide financial support in dignified conditions. 	1
E04113	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa. 	0
E04114	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because we need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.	1
E04115	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because we need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	0
E04119	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because the country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.	1
E04120	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because  It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	1
E04121	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!	1
E04122	We not do not want illegal migration. because i do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	1
E04123	We not need a better distribution of refugees because the dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all. 	0
E04124	We not need an inclusive and pluralistic European society because europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.	0
E04126	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because we are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.	0
E04127	We not don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because what are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant.	0
E04128	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route. because the proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	0
E04130	We not need a better distribution of refugees because the key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment.  So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.  	0
E04131	We not need a better distribution of refugees because illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.   	0
E04132	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because i have no trouble with, non-western, immigrants.  I have trouble with 'mass immigration'.  What happens is when they come in large numbers they do not integrate anymore.  They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'	1
E04138	We not need a better distribution of refugees. because if you want migrants, invite them into your home.	0
E04139	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	0
E04140	There should be no illegal migration because this is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	0
E04141	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration. because the EU needs to establish a legal means of preventing illegal migration that is encouraged by the Turkish government and by privately funded NGOs, which are acting against the interest of the EU.	0
E04142	Thenot re should be no illegal migration. because what does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece. 	1
E04143	Thenot re should be no illegal migration. because what does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.	1
E04144	We need a single immigration policy. because we do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.   	0
E04145	We need a single immigration policy. because but also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	1
E04146	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because without the refugee deal, the migrants will return to invade us. 	0
E04147	We need a better EU migration policy. because it is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.  	0
E04148	We need a better EU migration policy. because the EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off. 	0
E04149	We not need a single immigration policy. because nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity.  Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	0
E04151	We not need a single immigration policy. because the EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter.  The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality. 	1
E04154	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.	0
E04155	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration. 	1
E04157	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists! 	0
E05001	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society because complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.	0
E05002	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness because whenever you find yourself in crisis, and the EU is in crisis, it is a good idea to return to core business. And in the case of the EU, the core business is economy, trade, and security. That's where the focus should be.	0
E05003	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness because the more dynamic the economy, the stronger the innovation and worldwide influence the EU will have, including soft power.	0
E05004	The EU should focus more on ensuring the success of the internal market, and on improving its competitiveness because the Covid-19 pandemic showed us that the European Union is not able to come up with technological innovations that could strengthen our economic position. 	0
E05005	The EU should implement a common pension fund because the EU has some rules on how social security systems are coordinated (Regulation 883/2004/EC). EU rules ensure that the pension rights accrued in each country are added together and paid out by the pension insurance institution of the Member State of affiliation. But the bureaucratic nightmare is probably just as guaranteed.  A better solution would be a transparent and digital platform that collects pension entitlements from all EU member states. That way, every citizen would have an overview of his or her pension entitlements at all times, not just until when they are due.	1
E05010	The EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.  because the standardized retirement age would not only be fairer in an open market, but it would also (and even more so in the future) prevent any complexities with being paid their retirement for those who have made their contributions in different Member States throughout their lives. Even though there is to be at least a central system for this (a step in the right direction), one will only receive a share of one's retirement from a particular Member State once one reaches the retirement age of that Member State.	1
E05012	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms because bad governance, unreasonable spending, and corruption are damaging and unsustainable which means, we can't afford to leave them alone if we want to have a future. 	1
E05013	The EU should improve public management and anti-corruption mechanisms because the EU needs to focus on simplifying and standardizing European processes and procedures associated with public management and creating efficient and effective anti-corruption mechanisms. This will reduce the financial resources to be made available to the most relevant areas of intervention at the EU, country, and regional Levels.	1
E05016	Thenot  EU should put more pressure on the non-euro area member states to adopt the single currency because there is a reason why these states don't want to join the common currency: their economies are more flexible and doing far better without it. If we really want more countries to start using the euro, we need to make the euro better, not pressure or force others into our inefficient system. 	0
E05017	The EU should implement a common pension fund because i find it distressing and unreasonable to force an individual to leave behind their hard-earned pension pot. There should be a mechanism that stops this practice. Just as I can move myself, my family, furniture, car, and bank accounts freely within the EU, I should have the same right to move and merge my pensions into a single unit. 	0
E05018	Thenot  EU should equalize the retirement age for all Europeans.  because retirement is often funded by taxes and taxes are decided by each member state. So each member state should also be the one who decides how those taxes are spent. For some countries, a retirement age of 65 may be unaffordable or undesirable, while for others it may not.	0
E05019	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU because the COVID crisis has shown, that we are very vulnerable.  Critical industries must stay in Europe. Infrastructure in the EU especially critical infrastructure must remain under full and absolute European control.	0
E05020	Food health and industry companies should be located within the EU because it will bring the EU more jobs, less unemployment, and more added value.	1
E05025	Catalan should be an official language of the European Parliament because there are languages that are spoken by fewer people and are official	1
E05026	We not need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because the European Parliament in its current form is completely inadequate at representing the interests of all citizens, including the labor force. I cannot agree to give it more power until it is ensured that the MEPs are more responsive to their constituents. Electing them from individual election districts (not lists) and reducing their mandate to 2-3 years would be a good first step. 	0
E05027	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because real democracy cannot do without economic democracy. If the major decisions about our future life (investments, inventions, production) are made outside social control, then there is no real democracy.  Without proper social consultation, there is no prospect for a fair Europe.	0
E05028	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because the undemocratic nature and perception of the presidency and the commission were used very effectively during the Brexit referendum campaign to change the minds of even the most reasonable pro-EU and anti-Brexit voters as EU political representatives were already remote and inaccessible to many people, with unrecognized names, faces, and campaign points.	0
E05029	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because having leaders with great power across Europe that nobody directly voted for is of great concern. Unless the EU radically democratizes the presidency (creating the position which failed several referenda) as well as the commission, it will be used again and again to stoke anti-EU sentiment.	0
E05030	The EU should set up physical offices, where citizens can address their concerns about Europe because as we are transitioning into a more extensive digital age every day we still should not forget that as we age it gets harder to be quick with digital news, information, and advances in society. Therefore even right now our current older generations and future older generations need a physical touch point where competent people would be able to introduce on the spot what that one person as a citizen of the European Union can do that exact day to influence the benefit of Europe and their country.	0
E05031	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because we need to strengthen citizens' trust in the European project! This requires more transparency and accountability, in particular when it comes to access to documents and democratic decision-making. The 'Better Regulation' approach of the Commission which focuses on cutting costs and burdens prioritizes business interests over general interests and should be abandoned. The European project needs to benefit the many and not the few!	1
E05034	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because in order to promote European peace, prosperity, and precious diversity, a different administration system is needed: a federal Europe, based on a democratic federal constitution instead of anarchy-provoking EU treaties. 	0
E05035	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because catalonia must become independent from the Spanish dictatorial repression that tries to end the Catalan language and culture.	0
E05036	Thenot re can be no real European democracy without the autonomous fiscal power of the EU. because no. If the parliament was given free rein to start taxing people directly, they would of course abuse this power to fund their own pet projects because MEPs want to feel important and increase their own power above all else. It's good that the member states (via council decisions) can explicitly decide the size of the EU budget. And until the democratic deficit and other systemic problems in the EU are fixed, it's good that the budget is kept at 1-2% of the total EU GDP.	1
E05037	Thenot  EU must be confederal and not federal because we need a real and effective European democracy, therefore, a European Federation.	0
E05039	We not need to strengthen the participation of citizens in the design and processes of the EU because first, we should empower people more: put an emphasis on education and build a control mechanism for internet propaganda, e.g. force transparency on which content is truly human and which is sponsored or created by organizations and companies. Second, we should criminalize deliberate misinformation properly. Third, we should restructure the representation of people in the European Union. After all the above-mentioned, we can think about establishing a more binding role of petitions to the European Parliament.	0
E05040	We need a common EU TV channel free of charge for people in all Member States because the language barrier and a weak influence on local thinking, allow local propaganda to pass on distorted and untrue information about what is happening in the EU to their citizens. Local governments have easy work to appropriate the positive things that the EU has achieved and, conversely, seduce its own failure on 'European bureaucracy'.	0
E05042	Thenot  EU should be involved in the creation of a media-funding framework because in other words, EU (taxpayer)-sponsored propaganda.	1
E05043	The federal features of the European Treaties need to be strengthened. because we must move towards full co-decision power for the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity for climate, energy, social affairs, and taxation policies.	0
E05044	The federal features of the European Treaties need to be strengthened. because there is a lack of security and defense policy that can realistically be achieved by strengthening the Euro body as the 28th European army. 	0
E05045	Thenot  president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because directly electing the president of the commission makes the most susceptible to political sway, which would kill the commission as a body of technical experts.  	0
E05046	Thenot  president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because how would the candidates be selected? One per country? That just makes it a tight race between the two countries with the largest population (assuming one vote per person). Why would e.g. a Greek person vote for a Swedish candidate? How would even a Swedish candidate campaign in such a way as to appeal to Greek voters?	1
E05047	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because europe was composed of 13 countries in 1870 and 23 in 1914. Maybe it's time to change borders without bloodshed.	0
E05048	Thenot  president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because in Germany, the President of the Executive is not elected by the people directly either. The reason for this is the horrible experience during the Third Reich. The Parliament - as the only constitutional institution being directly elected - has a stronger stand if the President is not elected directly. However I definitely support, that the Parliament becomes stronger and more influential. 	0
E05049	EU not citizens should be allowed to direct vote for more decisions because direct democracy is too open to manipulation by populists and malefactors via social media. A transparent representative democracy with a solid lid on lobbyism is to be preferred.	0
E05050	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press because transparency is the first key to real democracy. Although today, Council meetings are partially live-streamed, most of the meetings are behind closed doors. This is an especially big problem with the Eurogroup and Eurosummit, which are shady informal meetings.  Or think about all the meetings between diplomats (Coreper) and civil servants (working groups and committees), where ±90% of decisions are made, for the Council to be rubberstamped. Meetings that most citizens don't even know about. 	0
E05051	Council meetings should be open to the public and the press because in order to strengthen democracy in the EU, Council meetings should be open to the public and the press. Only in open Council meetings are the Ministers of the Member States forced to clearly state the national interests they can vouch for in relation to their national partners and Voters. Together with the European Parliament, it focuses on an open political debate and decision-making process.	0
E05052	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because we live in the XXI century. We do not want any repression of peripheries by their state center. Within the European Union, we should welcome the blessing of decentralism and localism, including the self-determination of stateless peoples and stronger autonomies within confederal agreements. If not in Europe, where? If not now, when?	0
E05053	The EU should synchronize national elections  because the only thing Europeans don’t do together is politics. This is because national parties - not EU parties - run the show within and across Europe. After 70 years of integration, the EU lacks a European party system capable of fostering a genuine transnational space of political debate and dialogue where citizens can understand, influence, and participate in decision-making affecting their common interests as Europeans. This must change.	1
E05054	The EU should synchronize national elections  because the political composition of the European Council - and therefore the EU’s political center of gravity - continuously changes during the EU political cycle, thus preventing clearer government majorities to emerge within these two European Councils.   	0
E05055	The EU should synchronize national elections  because national elections synchronization would finally make it possible to strengthen the effectiveness of the Council of the EU, by eliminating the blockages caused by the constant renewal of Ministers, which considerably slows down decision-making.  	0
E05056	The EU should synchronize national elections  because synchronizing national elections would allow European citizens to engage in major pan-European campaigns.	0
E05059	Thenot  President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage because a direct election of a European president is a travesty of democracy. It would be only a mediatic competition among 'plastic' leaders.  Something very similar to The Simulacra (Dick's 1964 science fiction novel).  We are not a 'nation', we are a confederation of nations.	0
E05060	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because decision-making is today made unilaterally minding short-term economic interests and employers' demands. We need a social, progressive policy in the EU.	0
E05061	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because  It is also very important that the EU does not destroy national progressive labor laws and social protection provisions in third-party countries via Agreements as it tried with Switzerland and the Institutional Framework Agreement. 	1
E05062	Counot ncil meetings should be open to the public and the press because it would render the meetings useless since they would only be able to express official statements and instead negotiate new ideas without pressure.	0
E05063	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because according to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (the ICCPR), ‘[a]ll peoples have the right of self-determination. By virtue of that right, they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development. The right to self-determination also has its economic content which gives the people the right to freely ‘dispose of their natural wealth and resources without prejudice to any obligations arising out of international economic cooperation, based upon the principle of mutual benefit, and international law.'	0
E05064	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because europe needs a proper parliament including a right to initiative combined with strong involvement of social partners, e.g. through European Social Dialogue or the partnership principle in regional funds.	0
E05066	Votnot ing for European Parliament Elections should be mandatory because high voter turnout is usually desirable, but it's a symptom, not the root cause. Forcing people to go to the polls doesn't mean they will make more informed choices. Besides, voter turnout is a good metric that tells us where the potential problems of voter disenfranchisement are which is the first step to addressing them.	0
E05067	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because after so many years, so many wars, and so many forced exiles all over Europe and all over the world, it may be time to rectify our errors and return the old given rights to the many national groups that have been eliminated by force or conquest or undesired immigration. There is now a good example of this happening in Ukraine by the Russian occupation.	0
E05068	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because self-determination is a basic collective human right. Catalans practiced this right in 2017.  Since then the Catalan Republic is kidnaped by Spanish lawfare, with the elected president Puigdemont in exile within Europe and more than 3000 Catalan activists suffering political persecution as a consequence.  Ignoring this conflict within the core of Europe by European Institutions can undermine the EU at its very start.  If you sincerely believe in human rights, recognize the Catalan Republic officially. This crucial step will enforce European democracy, the Democracy of Citizens that feel free and respected within European borders.	0
E05069	The EU should focus on pragmatism because the attempt to shove the postmodern version of liberalism down Europeans' throats has contributed greatly to the current crisis of the EU. 	0
E05070	The EU should focus on pragmatism because pragmatism was in the EU’s DNA since its inception, but this is sadly no longer the case. The current EU is not a moral authority, it is a political organization based on mutual interests and political diversity.	0
E05071	The EU should focus on pragmatism because pragmatism entails the protection and promotion of European interests, banning top-down ideology, and respecting the cultural and political individuality of every Member state.	0
E05072	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because every nation with its own language and culture, which demands the same status as a sovereign nation within Europe, must have the right to be recognized and respected by people and other member nations/states.	0
E05073	Thenot  president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because no, the direct election of a single leader by the people gives too much power to this person. And anyhow: nobody can know another person well enough. Look at the USA: the candidates for president are not real people but are constructed by PR agencies.	0
E05074	Thenot  president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because the European Commission has to be independent. It is not allowed to take instructions from any country, lobby group, or anyone else. An elected head of the Commission would make nonsense of the principle of independence that is vital to the trust in the Commission's job. He or she would be beholden to the group that elected him or her and make the job impossible.	0
E05076	We need to ensure improvements to the European Union's decision-making processes with increased transparency and accountability because we all want to see transparent, democratic, and value-based policy-making.  The right to good administration is embedded in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and should guide the EU's actions.	0
E05079	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because there are several international treaties, including those of the United Nations and those of the European Union—to which the member states are bound—that recognize the right to self-determination of peoples. Unfortunately, the European Union does not provide any sufficient and appropriate mechanism in order to allow the citizens and the peoples of the Union, i.e. individually and collectively, to enjoy that right. I thus approve and endorse the proposal for a clarity mechanism on the right to self-determination within the European Union, facilitating an internal enlargement process for greater subsidiarity.	0
E05080	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because the right for stateless nations and peoples to democratically decide on their own future must be respected, and for that purpose, we advocate for the creation of a mechanism of clarity at the EU level, aimed at facilitating and resolving any eventual self-determination disputes through democratic means. This tool should ensure that positions cannot be imposed nor debates prevented.	0
E05081	The European Union needs to equip itself with the institutional and legal tools to resolve democratic conflicts on sovereignty within its own borders. because in a democracy, people have the right to decide on any issue that affects their lives. If more than half of the inhabitants of a region want to form an independent state, they have the right to do so. Going against it is going against the will of the majority of citizens, and therefore, against the very essence of democracy.	0
E05082	The president of the European Commission should be elected by the people of the EU because european political parties should be independent of national parties. There should be primaries open for the citizens to choose the candidate, it would increase citizen participation and involvement in EU politics.	1
E05083	Thenot  President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage because i don't think the EU needs the same problem as France where the elections are just about which guy people should select and which candidate looks the best to handle the position. 	0
E05084	Thenot  President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage because what will the Europeans think if the candidates are always, for each election, either French, German, or maybe Spanish, and neither coming from small countries?  	0
E05085	Thenot  President of the European Commission should be directly elected by direct universal suffrage because to have a chance that one candidate (with a good chance to win) comes from your own country, I think people from little countries can wait 40 years. This will definitely destroy the European belonging feeling you want to promote with this idea.	1
E05087	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists  because intensive Care Medicine deserves to be added to the Annex V, as well as all citizens of the EU deserve top standards of critical care and safety when admitted to this demanding environment.	1
E05088	There is a necessity for a European framework for the free movement of intensivists  because the pandemic has put European Intensive Care Units (ICUs) under extreme pressure. The most important lesson learned early on in the chaos of the pandemic was that equipment and medicines are necessary to save lives, but without adequately trained human resources, these elements are irrelevant. Ventilators don’t operate themselves.   We saw patients in very critical condition being moved away from their families from one Member State to another to receive treatment while allowing the doctors to move would be much more efficient and less life-threatening for the patients. 	1
E05089	EU not needs an action plan against digital addiction  because technology brings people together when they are distant, accelerates bureaucratic procedures, it allows us to work from home or from any country in the EU or outside. It allows for an immense flow of information to be easily accessible to us. As long as people do not want to do illegal online activities, it is each person’s individual decision what to do with their own online time or how much time they might want to be online.	1
E05090	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health because the COVID-19  pandemic has shown us why robust public health and social care systems are so important for everyone, for rich and poor alike. Alongside other public services, they should be orientated towards the common good and not towards private gain. This makes them the backbone of fair and sustainable societies.	1
E05094	The EU should develop a European Youth Platform for mental health because such a platform if it provides youngsters with free or at least affordable mental-health assistance, will help them finally able to overcome our society’s barriers to taking care of our mental health and emotional well-being. 	1
E05098	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because horrible idea. Next, you will limit water or air?! This is not the way to move on climate change. You can do much more via mass politics and not focus on individuals or limit their freedoms. If you want to stop eating meat, do so, I won't.	0
E05099	Primary Health Care (PHC) is an indispensable good for equitable and high-quality care in Europe and beyond because the range of primary care services should be available to all patients universally, with special emphasis on those at the margins, often in most need.	1
E05101	EU countries should slightly reduce health insurance contributions for all citizens who do not use tobacco products  because i think increasing taxes on tobacco could do a similar thing.  But then we would also have to increase the contributions to health insurance for people who overeat sugar, use sunbeds, etc., to be fair. 	1
E05102	Paynot -as-you-go public health insurance funds should only be used for the most serious illnesses because this only works if you're young and healthy, otherwise, you're a bad risk for private health insurance and it will become even more expensive	1
E05107	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work because it seems like a no-brainer to say something like this, but actually the way, we handle soil, must change massively to halt the climate crisis and mitigate its consequences. Thus we need to recultivate and restore abandoned and contaminated places and shift agriculture to regenerative agriculture or restoration agriculture. We need to stabilize family farms and make them ecologically, financially, and socially sustainable. We need between big and medium-sized farms and also highly productive smallholder farms and wildlife reservoirs. This all depends on a lot of labor, engaged people, and legal and conceptual infrastructure. Having all this in place will foster urban areas as well. 	1
E05108	Rural areas should become more attractive for life and work because if rural areas are to become more attractive to live in and work, it is essential to bet on innovation and the creation of quality jobs	1
E05113	Doctors should be paid based on how many people they successfully treated because unfortunately, in our society, a healthy person is not profitable. Pharma is a big business, doctors are being paid for prescribing drugs.  Modern healthcare should be preventive. Doctors should be encouraged and paid for curing people and keeping them healthy.  Good quality healthcare should be accessible in every part of the world and should be free as there is nothing more important than human life.	1
E05115	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy because it shouldn't be the European families who pay for the damage caused by multinational corporations. 	1
E05116	The EU needs a more rational Green Policy because raising prices in the energy sector cannot be the solution in the fight against climate change. The European Commission allows international firms to increase their prices, and as a result, household costs are rising at an incredible rate. The EU should definitely revoke these decisions, and instead of placing the burden on its own citizens, it should instead support them to lead a more sustainable way of life. The green transition should not be a heavy burden borne on the average citizen’s shoulders 	1
E05118	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy. because this is especially true when we know how much alcohol is damaging the brain, in particular in the developing brain of teenagers. Also unlike cannabis, over-consumption of alcohol leads to death so I would say that this product is much more dangerous. Yet unlike cannabis, alcohol is legal. 	1
E05119	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy. because in France, political repression fueled by rightwing ideology and ignorance led cities like Marseille to develop rampant crime that fed on the lucrative market of cannabis. Worst, this criminality is intertwined with radical Islam. In poor neighborhoods, the youth will choose the easy money and start dealing. 	1
E05120	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy. because tax revenues generated by cannabis could be redirected towards education in poor neighborhoods (increasing teachers' pay in these areas, reducing the number of teachers per class) in order to give these populations a better future. But unlike in the Netherlands, production should also be legal and highly regulated by the state.	1
E05121	Public transport in EU cities should be free because i think a very good transportation system within European cities is very much desirable. There is not enough space for many parking lots anyway, electro-cars won't be able to replace common cars, and urban spaces have to become greener.  In order for many people to accept that the use of cars will have been a thing of the past, they should be offered very good alternatives in the future and, hopefully, appreciate green mobility through good public transport within urban areas.	1
E05122	Public transport in EU cities should be free because the incentive to provide free public transport in European cities in the future would make it easier for people, especially in the cities, to accept and appreciate that there will be fewer and fewer cars. People who benefit from current examples are happy about it. 	1
E05124	We need a European Clinical Registries Platform because a common digital platform where data will be recorded in an anonymized way could also be very helpful for the future not only in case of new pandemic situations. However, as data itself has a market value and as we have learned about the global interdependency in an emergency situation e.g. with vaccines, no company should capitalize on this data.  The data should be accessible for public research and used for monitoring public health e.g. by European institutions	1
E05125	The EU needs a European research center because it would help to further unite the nations.	1
E05126	The EU needs a European research center because during the pandemic, the EU was unable to produce a vaccine on its own, mainly due to the fact that not enough money is invested in research within its different member states. Gathering the strength of the 27 member states in research and health could be a real asset for the EU and its citizens, but also for its influence overseas and its independence.	1
E05127	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because i believe that the problem is not WHAT we eat but rather HOW food is produced.   When we talk about meat, we should make a distinction between industrial production (which is damaging our environment) and family-run businesses once (which is not). Instead of prohibiting food (something that is practically speaking impossible to do) we should rather enhance local food solutions and increase people's awareness regarding the impact of their buying choices. Our goal should be making local products and green goods available to everyone and not a privilege of people who are wealthy enough to be able to afford them.	1
E05129	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because no, this is a horrible idea to force people to go vegan. While I agree that we, as a society, are eating too much meat, which is bad for both the environment and our health, this will only create tension and anger towards the EU. 	0
E05130	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because i have no illusions that rich and influential people will find a way to get as much meat as they want and then distribute it on the black market.	0
E05131	Everyone should have equal access to affordable and high-quality public services, including health because public services of good quality and universal access are key to ensuring fairer, more inclusive, and equal societies. They have a clear redistributive effect and help steer development in a more sustainable direction. The Covid-19 crisis if anything helped to prove the crucial role that the public sector and public services play and must continue playing!	0
E05133	Alternative medicine should be more accepted because traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine is a safe and efficient way to improve well-being, and happiness and prevent illness. Also, an innumerable amount of people have got significant palliation or even total cure in cases, which the official health care system, unfortunately, couldn't help. This is clearly an area, where countries, civilizations, and schools of thought could learn a lot from each other.	1
E05139	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because the government does not have any right to use the taxpayer's money to propagandize the people to encourage what to eat and not to eat. It is not the responsibility of the government.	0
E05140	We need to move towards drug reform, which will change our outdated drug policy.  because today, cannabis repression is simply a political posture aimed to target rightwing voters, not a rational policy. 	0
E05145	The EU needs a European research center because i think the problem in the EU is the incompetence to establish inventions in the market. There are lots of inventions that are made and funded by public EU research facilities brought into the market by small startups. In the end, they are picked like ripe fruits by the US or Chinese companies where the big money is made.	0
E05146	Thenot  EU government should encourage people to eat less meat because i think forcing people to eat a limited amount of meat is totally the wrong way because of the following reasons:  1. It would cause so much more bureaucracy  2. forbidding it would understandably make a lot of people very mad. I mean who likes to be told what to eat?  3. I think it's important to have the freedom to eat what you want I think a much better solution would be to increase the tax on meat. Making it less attractive for people.	1
E05148	Cornot onavirus protection should be advertised on TV and social media because that's a terrible idea. The government propaganda machine is already going at full steam. Do you have any idea what the psychological impact of these kinds of messages is when you blast them at people all day every day for over a year?  Depression, suicides, and domestic violence are all the consequences of living in a hopeless and high-stress environment for a protracted period of time and are at record levels throughout Europe. In this entire covid crisis the so-called 'health experts' have consequently ignored the fact that your mental state has a direct influence on your health. i.e.: If you're stressed out, you're more likely to get sick. Instead, they have willfully created panic. Just like your ad would.	1
E05154	Public transport in EU cities should be free because i think the EU should subsidies troubled cash-strapped cities to reduce ticket prices or completely remove any charges so that people are vivisected to hop on the bus rather than in the car. As I student, I would have been in the city center a lot more and spent money around the shops if I could afford the bus fair in the first place. 	1
E06003	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health because nothing illustrates to me more the fall of European ethics than pro-abortion arguments. Nobody can dispute that a baby in the womb is alive and human, and yet people call their killing a 'human right'. How could we fall so low?	0
E06004	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health because juridical protection of dignity, right to life, and integrity of every human being from conception are of fundamental importance for the future of Europe.  The dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected. This is enounced by the ECJ in the Brüstle vs Greenpeace case, which recalls the definition of the human embryo as the beginning of the development of the human being. To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit that presuppose the destruction of human embryos.	0
E06005	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because it is absolutely necessary that we have a system of accountability, both for member states and other countries. Human rights and liberties always come first!	0
E06006	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states because hungary’s and Poland’s governments have ruthlessly corrupted their judgments to get a free card on abstract EU funds. Enough! If even Romania can be carried out to join the enhanced cooperation, those last two must be forced.	0
E06007	The EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states because the EU must take a strong position against corruption and be in favor of an independent, supranational proscecutor that is the EPPO.	0
E06008	Thenot  EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because the European Union is not a country and we must respect other countries' electoral choices.	0
E06011	Thenot  EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech because i have advice on how you can defend against anything on the Internet. Turn it OFF. And one more piece of advice, try to study something about freedom and responsibility, they are not just mere words. Plato, Socrates, Hayek, Borovský, Auberon Herbert, Herbert Spencer, Roger Scruton, Ronald Reagan (speeches), Ben Shapiro, Jordan Peterson ... There are texts thousands of years old and also recent books ... you can start anywhere you wish ...	0
E06013	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because mostly agree. Only if a country violates basic human rights its vote in the EU should be suspended and/or financial sanctions imposed, tailored to target the offending government and its supporters. But such a country should NOT be excluded from the EU, because that would mostly harm the opposition which is likely to be more EU-friendly.	0
E06014	Gernot many should start paying reparations share for any damaged countries of Europe up to 100 years after its attack on international society because will Russia also pay their share? Will Austria pay for starting WW1 or will it be Serbia? Will Poland and Hungary pay for occupation of parts of Czechoslovakia in 1938/1939? Will France pay for starting napoleonic wars? It is time to forget what happened almost 100 years ago and focus on the future and I say that as a Czech citizen whose country was occupied by Austria, Germany/Poland/Hungary and then by SSSR and all eastern satelite states.	0
E06015	People with disabilities should be more represented  because according to the United Nations Convention on the rights of people with disabilities, the European Union “shall closely consult with and actively involve persons with disabilities” on political decisions that concern them. Meanwhile the “European Strategy for the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2021-2030” hardly mentioned people with intellectual and neurological disabilities.  Now the Conference for the Future of Europe wants to be an inclusive citizen consultation but is still not making it a priority to include citizens with Trisomy 21, autism, or members of other neurodivergent communities. Ableism keeps getting perpetuated in the EU and it needs to stop.  We want more representation! We want people with Down Syndrome to be fully included in the European Union institutions!	0
E06017	Thenot  EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states because absolutely unacceptable because it would lead to the politicization of the justice system.	0
E06018	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because several member states have been turned into dictatorships a year ago, and there is no sign of a return to democracy. Freezing temporarily their EU membership status is to be considered to those where there is no more freedom in crossing borders (BE), even inside borders (DE, FR), no more press freedom (most), no more debate (most), no more press or individual liberty.	0
E06019	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because to have any credibility when addressing foreign countries regarding issues of human rights violations, curbs on the freedom of speech and press, democracy, and more, the EU must ensure that its Member States meet minimum standards on these fronts too.	0
E06020	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because current concerns about rule of law infringements are simply being brushed off as 'national matters'. If this continues, how can the EU assume authority to promote democracy abroad? More strict and enforceable minimum standards must be introduced, under clearly increasing penalties for non-compliance. If shared values and democracy are indeed a requisite to be a part of the EU, then continued adherence should be a precondition to remain a part of it.	0
E06022	The EU needs a free but correct press because i totally agree, maybe would be glad if a press company could be sanctioned for misleading information, or even if it repeats, they could have their press licenses voided. It is crazy how much misleading information is out there, many people are sharing it and nobody is taking responsibility for it. In addition, there could be a discussion in which only verified users (real people) could have access to the press's online chat/discussion under the reported topic.	0
E06023	The EU needs a free but correct press because we are increasingly witnessing malicious journalism, corrupted by feelings and disinformation. The purpose of the press services must, as soon as possible, be to bring the news back to the public in the most detailed and detailed manner possible, without inciting malicious and incorrect drawing of attention.	0
E06024	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood because in fact, political NGOs advocating for any cause whatsoever should be banned from schools and kindergartens. 	0
E06025	We need family and child protection against political agendas until their adulthood because as Europe bears the burden of the XXth century authoritarian regimes (right and left) and saw their children ideologically possessed by fascist and communist governmental propaganda (Hitlerjugend (right) and Pioneer (left) movements), we need to limit the access of the children - as one of the most vulnerable groups of our community - to every political ideology and propagating associations. 	0
E06026	Thenot  EU should ensure a free, independent, and functioning judiciary in its Member States because the administration of justice is a member state competence. Shadowy attempts by federalist institutions to enhance their influence at the expense of the sovereign member states are contrary to the letter of the EU Treaties, counter-productive, and have contributed greatly to the crisis of the EU by alienating national institutions. This is especially the case for courts. Several member states' high courts have declared the ECJ ultra vires (acting beyond its powers). This lawlessness on the part of federalist institutions must stop with immediate effect, and we must reaffirm the principles of subsidiarity and conferral. 	1
E06027	Thenot  EPPO’s jurisdiction should be extended to all member states because it is unacceptable. Every nation has the right to organize its own prosecution system and no foreign prosecutor should be allowed to operate in independent states, it is a threat to the sovereignty of the member states.	0
E06028	Thenot  EU needs a free but correct press because the EU deciding who is a journalist amounts to the EU deciding what is true.	0
E06036	Thenot  current differing legal cultures of the Member States need to be developed into a common legal culture in Europe because legal traditions are different for a reason. They are the result of centuries of organic legal evolution. They cannot be overwritten with a stroke of a pen. 	0
E06041	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe because abortion kills a human being. It can be justified only in very rare cases. 	0
E06042	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe because every human being has a conscience that allows them to recognize what is true and what is good, and it is by virtue of this awareness that we demand that no European Union funds be allocated to activities that destroy human embryos.	0
E06043	EU officials should be allowed to use the expression “Ladies and Gentlemen” because stop woke ideology introducing Orwellian newspeak!	0
E06044	People with disabilities should be more represented  because aborting children with Down is not love, is not an inclusive society, it is discrimination against the most vulnerable.	0
E06045	Thenot  EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because the EU has no business 'promoting democracy' anywhere beyond its borders. Have we not seen sufficiently clearly in the past two decades where 'democracy export' leads?! Freedom bombs and human suffering everywhere.  No, the EU must fully respect the sovereignty and national characters of all nations of this world. And that includes its own member states. The EU must immediately return to the letter of the EU treaties, and reaffirm in the strongest term the principles of conferral and subsidiarity. 	1
E06050	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health because we are all here to fight the prohibition of eugenic practices such as abortion which organize and consequently encourage the preventive elimination of individuals who do not comply with the social, medical, and family criteria set by the ideal of man. What a perfect 21st century!	1
E06052	The EU should enforce the obligation to respect the Rule of Law within its borders because the EU should do it in an impartial manner and act against all countries regardless of political ideology. The EU should stand out to help all minorities and not just the politically advantageous ones. The oppression of Catalonians and Hungarian minorities outside its border is a constant problem since WW2 and it is completely ignored. If the EU wants to convince the masses, then it can't just cherrypick issues.	0
E06055	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health because from the Association Christian in Democracy (Spain), we are clear that life is the greatest good of a society and as such must be protected from its conception to its natural end. For this reason, it should be part of the European Union's charter of fundamental rights and be protected from attacks against defenseless human beings, such as in the cases of abortion and euthanasia.	0
E06056	Thenot  European Union, as a Union of values, should limit its support to countries that do not want to adhere to European values and violate the rights of their citizens because this is an attempt to combine the 'Multi-speed Europe' concept with the idea that European principles and values can be used as ideological clubs to beat those who engage in wrongthinking over the head with. If you insist on a set of shared EU principles and values that go beyond a mere symbolic declaration, these principles and values must include our real heritage: the Judeo-Christian values that have made Europe great. Traditional family values are first and foremost. All these values must be clearly defined in a legal sense.	0
E06057	People with disabilities should be more represented  because people with trisomy 21 in Europe have much higher rates of unemployment, social exclusion, poverty, and discrimination. The European Union must make it a priority to change this situation.	1
E06058	The EU should enforce minority protection because it seems that the EU is much more concerned with the rights of sexual minorities than with ethnic minorities. This is a universal problem for all ethnic minorities in the EU.  Outside the EU, there are even more severe problems. Ukraine, for instance, forces kids to study in Ukrainian, refusing them and their parents the right to receive an education in the language they choose. Seems utterly barbaric in the 21st century, but the EU does nothing about this, despite the influence it holds over Kyiv. 	1
E06059	The EU should enforce minority protection because unfortunately, the values and rights are interpreted and exercised differently in the states of the European Union. Whether we are speaking about minority protection, language rights, or cultural values. We can see every day that the EU is constantly retaliating against the Hungarians in Transylvania, when, despite the legislation in force, it ignores the lawlessness and atrocities committed against the Hungarians as a native minority. Furthermore, the European Union should give priority to all situations in which Hungarians in Transylvania are victims of discrimination.	1
E06061	People with disabilities should be more represented  because europe must lead the way when it comes to integrating people with Down syndrome 	1
E06062	EU not institutions should prioritize the struggle against all forms of racism, also anti-Muslim bigotry, and antisemitism because judeo-Christian values are the cornerstone of European civilization - they deserve special protection because they made us who we are today.  Mass migration from people with cultures totally alien to Europe is the phenomenon that most threatens EU security and cohesion. Everyone's human rights must be respected, but illegal migrants are criminals and should be treated as such, not pampered. Mass migration must end.	1
E06063	Thenot  EU needs a wider definition of gender-based violence and an intersectional approach to end it because 'We most definitely do not need a wider definition of 'gender-based' anything. 'Gender' is a politicized left-wing concept. I certainly encourage wider protection from violence against women and girls. That should most definitely include protection from the violence and coercion young women face from 'trans' activists. We also want nothing to do with 'intersectionality' which is a neo-Marxist concept of overlapping oppressions. No one is being oppressed in Europe.	0
E06064	Every human has the right to receive reliable information about the movement and distribution of public funds because we pay taxes and we have the right to see where our money goes. It’s very easy to implement through an online platform same as digital banking, but for the state. This will stamp out corruption and thereby free up a huge amount of money that we can spend on the needs of the population. 	1
E06065	The EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities that presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid, and public health because the defense of the equality of value and dignity of each and every single human life is decisive for the future of Europe. 	0
E06069	Thenot  EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector because ensure equal opportunities for girls and women, provide them sufficient maternity leave, and institute guarantees that will protect women's careers who choose to have children. Those are the steps we need, and most EU countries already have them (not that they cannot be improved). There's absolutely no need for quotas. 	0
E06071	Thenot  EU must ensure continued progress toward gender equality, women’s rights, and reproductive freedom because we are all for equal rights and opportunities for women, however, modern feminism has gone so far beyond the pale that it can no longer be supported.  The BBC has recently found out that 'Some lesbians are increasingly being pressured and coerced into accepting trans women as sexual partners' - in effect fourth-wave feminism has reached the point where males are once again telling females who to have sex with. This must stop.	0
E06075	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech because yes, the European Union needs effective policies to combat online hate speech and these need to be regularly updated as technology evolves and to take into account worldwide learning on how to effectively combat online hate speech.	0
E06076	The EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech because the internet has provided unprecedented opportunities to express and comment on almost anything. But this also brings with it responsibility. Where is the boundary between freedom of expression and speech hate speech, which is no longer tolerated by the law? How can we oppose such acts – such as insults, vulgarism, or threats on social networks? Or can everyone say anything on the internet?	0
E06077	Ideology should be aimed at popularizing the best human qualities and stopping everything that is directed against a human because aggression, division, and violence we see in mass media should be stopped. Only the best human qualities should be promoted, this way we will raise a generation of kind, caring, and responsible people.	0
E06078	Ideology should be aimed at popularizing the best human qualities and stopping everything that is directed against a human because this will create conditions for the development and education of a Human with a capital “H”, cultivating moral values in each person and society.  We should prohibit propaganda of violence, condemnation, and denunciation of any form of division, aggression, and anti-humane manifestations	0
E06079	Thenot  EU needs more effective policies to combat online hate speech because people's feelings arent all that important. If you have had enough of the Internet, you can always find yourself a hobby. 	0
E06084	Thenot  EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector because all wrong. Let everyone decide for himself (or herself). Forcing women into specific positions is bad ... and sexist I guess.	0
E06085	Thenot  EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector because quotas are always disgusting examples of oppression and evil. I don't want anything of that, I want freedom and free choice.	0
E06086	Thenot  EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector because if you want something like 'increasing the percentage of women in all sectors', you need to create more women or reduce the number of men. I will better not ask questions in this direction. 	0
E06087	Thenot  EU should adopt legislative measures aimed at increasing the percentage of women in the political sector because every harpy screams 'more (black) women in power' until Candace Owens appears. Clever, charming black woman, but she is too clever, pro-freedom, and conservative, and that is the problem. So it isn't about women, it's mere greed and desire for power and influence.	0
E06088	We need a Europe that respects life from conception is a humane Europe because every human has the right to live. The developing child in the womb, the children, the adults, and those who are of old age and need nursing.	0
E06089	People with disabilities should be more represented  because the United States is investing an average of more or less 25 million euros per year on health care research for people with Trisomy 21 while the European Union is lagging far behind with only 3 million per year. This huge difference is proof of the lack of political commitment in the European Union and shows how little the EU prioritizes health care and future health care for people with Trisomy 21. 	1
E06091	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because the situation of young people is difficult. Temporary jobs, precarious contracts, civic contracts replacing regular employment, forced self-employment, lack of basic social protection, and even age-discriminatory practices (also on the basis of age) are still the norm for millions of young people who are trying to make their way in the labor market. They need urgent help!	1
E06092	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities because esperanto is politically neutral: it is not used by any European nation. Although there is some culture connected to the language, there is no political or economic power imposing it. Also, where English is connected to the US, Canada, Australia, and other countries, Esperanto would be a truly European language.	1
E06093	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities because to build a common European understanding and to create a European identity, we need our own common language. 	1
E06094	Esperanto should replace English as the first foreign language in schools and universities because esperanto is linguistically neutral: The language was created with the principle of internationality in a European context. It’s democratic: There are no native speakers of Esperanto, or better yet not any monolingual speakers of Esperanto. Everyone has to learn it as a second language. As a result of this nobody will have an advantage over others and nobody can feel like a 'stranger' since nobody can feel like a 'native'. Everyone is respected regardless of their origin and not discouraged from learning the language.	0
E06095	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because i agree. Young people should have a voice in policymaking. Regulation needs to reduce forms of precarious work.  It is time to expand collective bargaining coverage to all forms of work. It is essential to introduce a right to decent housing and policies capping rents and limiting property market speculation. we urgently need investment to achieve this. Youth is the future, we have to take care of it.	1
E06097	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because a lot of programs nowadays sound really good on paper, but there always is someone bending the rules. There needs to be outside monitoring in every youth program of that sort 	0
E06098	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because we see this problem in many countries and the situation is getting worse - the pandemic, also, took its toll. Stable quality jobs and adequate social protection are necessary if we don't want to see a great strain on social systems in the long term. 	1
E06099	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because to prevent precarious conditions, we must put in place quality standards, they must be binding for all jobs created under EU and National recovery plans. Better monitoring and trade union involvement are needed to assess and report youth unemployment and NEET rates. At the moment these numbers hide forced mobility, involuntary part-time employment, and work in a grey and informal economy. Urgent measures are needed to fight youth unemployment and precarious working conditions in sectors where young people are overrepresented (tourism; gig economy…).	1
E06100	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because i agree. Stable, quality jobs and adequate social protection for everyone are necessary.  Trade unions have many proposals to achieve more equal and inclusive labor markets.  This goes hand in hand with policies to promote more equal, sustainable, and inclusive societies.  	1
E07001	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because we cannot afford a lost generation, so we need to invest in quality jobs and young people for our future!	1
E07002	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because the problem of youth employment has been there for a long time but was underlined again during the pandemic. Many young people are forced to move to a different country in order to find work. 	1
E07003	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because young people are too often working under precarious conditions. Think of short-term, zero-hour contracts and unpaid internships. Many of them can only get a job if they are registered as self-employed, carrying all the responsibilities themselves and still being underpaid. Everyone should be able to get a decent job and access social protection. Trade unions play a crucial role in addressing these issues and defending this vulnerable group, which is why it is important that young workers join a trade union.	1
E07004	All workers and unemployed should have access to social protection, including young people because . It is embedded in the core principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but those high and lofty principles must become a reality for all workers, old and young!	1
E07005	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country because integration and immigration in a host country require a lot of effort	0
E07006	Imprisonment of foreign criminals should be carried out in their country because this will relieve the European prison system. This would encourage many migrants to take responsibility for the laws of the host countries.	0
E07009	Thenot  EU needs tougher border protection because building walls is a sign of fear and weakness.	0
E07014	Thenot re should be a common EU migration and asylum policy because a common policy is a completely wrong solution. It will only lead to the fact that the system will be fully implemented on the terms of Sweden and Germany, who support open borders, and will bring down the entire EU and the traditional welfare states.	0
E07016	Thenot  fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated. because fear of the unknown is normal behavior. It has saved our race since ages starting when mankind was a simple monkey among others. 	0
E07017	Thenot  fear of migration is a fear of the unknown and is exacerbated. because additionally when fear is reinforced by facts like increased violence in every country with a high number of immigrants, and rapes of women it is not a problem of 'perception' but a simple reality.	0
E07018	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU.	0
E07019	We not need a better distribution of refugees because the dividing of refugees is a long-discussed plan. But in the end, no involved group agreed with these plans. Some countries do not like these people at all. 	0
E07020	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state because the EU should support democracies rather than dictatorships and value the support of democracy over economic gains. 	0
E07021	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state because china is acting against European values and violating intellectual property rights.	0
E07022	We do not want immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because no more non-European immigration. The native Europeans have said NO.	0
E07025	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene because too many times so-called leaders around the world like Trump and Boris Johnson have made a mockery of Europe and Europeans with zero response from EU leaders. These things affect people's pride and give out a sense of weakness.	0
E07027	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union because maybe while helping economic integration in Africa to happen, we will discover that we could go further in our own EU development. We could foster transnational companies which operate on both continents but not primarily the very big ones. I think of companies that supply solar power solutions to rural areas or microcredit banks. Create platforms where best choice and best practice solutions can evolve. This way, we can establish a single common market.	1
E07032	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because european citizens are the future of Europe! 	1
E07033	There should be 6 concrete proposals for migrants on the Balkan route. because the proposal of the Sardines to reform EU asylum policy is an excellent proposal, well and thoroughly written.	0
E07034	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because just arguing to keep migrants out is very shortsighted and unhistorical. By keeping migrants out, migration pressure will not abate. So what do you suggest for next year, 10 years from now?  	0
E07035	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because migration has been a fact of history and successful societies have found ways to turn migration into strength. In our case in order to alleviate the current challenge in the long term we need to alleviate migration pressure by making it attractive for migrants to stay put and help develop their own countries. Such a helpful project, a European Marshal Plan for Africa would be a good project to invest in. The long-term return on investment would be more than financial: A friendly neighbor continent, good relationships, access to the African market, and natural resources. That is not a short-term fix. And there is no short-term fix. We have to play the long game!	1
E07036	We do not need any immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because why can't Arab countries shelter refugees from other Arab countries? Same habits, religion and they have enough wealth.	1
E07037	Thenot  EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe because it's arrogant to tell us we should look for another name. Germans and Italians are Europeans just like Serbians or Macedonians. In the other words, Brits can call themselves Europeans and so can we! Therefore EU citizens are European.	1
E07038	We need a better EU migration policy  because his is the issue in politics and public sector policy making. No objectives are to be pursued. No problems to be solved. I guess it is the nature of the beast. Balancing conflicting interests. 	0
E07039	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation  because the EU is established on treaties, but treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by, and for the people.	1
E07040	We not need a combined education and migration policy for Africa and the Middle East. because the demographic problems for the EU, which are real, must be solved by encouraging child-bearing and a generous family policy, not through migration. We must celebrate motherhood and Moms. We must realize that raising a child involves serious costs in today's Europe.	1
E07044	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should lose its government/EU funding.	1
E07045	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union because with highly subsidized agricultural products the EU destroys local markets in African countries. This procedure should be stopped as soon as possible. EU agricultural subsidies should be replaced with incentives and support for a sustainable transition. The earlier we abandon these unfair and highly unsustainable subsidies the better for our own future health, social development, and climate future. Also, this will lead to a better relationship with African Union and enable better livelihoods for African farmers and citizens,  	1
E07046	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene because we have already done great damage to EU credibility by pointless posturing.	0
E07047	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because we should halt all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries into the EU. However, if we want to stop this immigration, we must stop its causes. Indeed, it is war, poverty, and European, Chinese and American neo-colonialism that make the people of African and Middle Eastern countries flee to Europe. So Europe must finally take responsibility and protect these countries from corruption, war, and neo-colonialism and help them to start their economy.	1
E07048	The EU must use its weight as a united global player in trade policy and put an end to foreclosure because for Europe to act outwardly as a unit, we must first look inward. At the psychological level, how can we create a European home market? What does it take, for example, for a resident of Spain to think of Czech printers as a local product? Will it be possible to reach an agreement on Europe's historical events and interpret them to everyone's satisfaction? This process will take some time.	1
E07049	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because migration from countries with incompatible cultural values and ideologies should be limited or stopped to ensure social cohesion in Europe. Regressive outdated ideologies and values should have no place in Europe. 	1
E07050	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because the migrants that are already (legally) here should be taught western values so they and their families can integrate/assimilate, as the age-old saying goes 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.	1
E07051	We not need a single immigration policy. because what we are now seeing are the first waves of a human tsunami. In sub-Saharan Africa, over years the population will have grown to 2,0 billion.  That is more than the people who live in the EU and US today.  At the same time, the Population in the EU is shrinking. When we keep the border open the EU as a viable society will disappear.  Not much of a future for the young Europeans.	0
E07052	We not need a better distribution of refugees because the key to successful immigration depends upon the possibility of employment.  So EU members are to decide whom they want to admit.  	1
E07053	We not need a better distribution of refugees because illegal immigrants have to be returned to UN refugee camps.   	1
E07054	There should be no illegal migration because entering the EU without a permit automatically excludes a person from any right to receive asylum. 	0
E07055	There should be no illegal migration because we must stop all loopholes - for example automatically rejecting asylum claims of anyone who enters Europe illegally.	1
E07056	There should be no illegal migration because this is just evidence. Immigration will be one of the most difficult topics in the next decades (or even years) due to the insane demographic rates the world is suffering nowadays, so immigration has to be closely monitored and all illegal immigration has to be blocked.	1
E07057	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society. because there need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean giving up European values and culture.	1
E07058	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society. because there need to be some rules for integration: Integration does not mean completely open borders.	1
E07059	The EU should strengthen development cooperation. because europe as a whole is the world’s leading donor. The European Union should strengthen the development cooperation action, focusing on inclusive development	1
E07060	Thenot re should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because in Conclusion, we should say: 'Europeans go home. Go home, leave every part of the world where we are making business, exploiting cheap labor, rare minerals, selling arms, invading foreign countries and exporting democracy, etc. '	0
E07061	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because multiculturalism creates chaos wherever it exists. Sweden's Stockholm has become the Rape Capital of the West, and the number of bombs and shootings has skyrocketed as well in that country. France is bordering on civil war, whole territories are not under state control anymore. Europe needs to stop migration and asylum indefinitely. We need to put our European peoples first, much like the entire world is doing while our civilization is committing suicide based on values imposed by sanctimonious narcissists. 	1
E07062	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because there's nothing wrong with not wanting your continent to become chaos and putting your people first, every civilization in this world takes that idea as self-evident. We need to negotiate Remigration deals with the 3rd countries to send their nationals back and we need to use Frontex to push back any migrants coming to our borders.	0
E07063	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because the EU leadership fails to carry out its fundamental duties: guard its border and protect its own people. Even 30 years after Schengen was introduced. 	0
E07064	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because immigration should not be part of humanitarian aid. Humanitarian aid should be delivered directly to Africa / Asia. The Turkey deal should eventually be abolished.	0
E07065	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because europe must stay Europe and people must not be imposed a cultural and religious change they do not want and which is insane. Look at what the Arabic or north African countries have become, after 1400 years of Islam.	0
E07068	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally, should be required to provide financial support in dignified conditions. 	1
E07069	Humanitarian organizations should be financially responsible in relation to illegal immigration. because a humanitarian association that helps a migrant to enter the EU illegally should also be dragged in front of the court for not taking the illegals to the closest safe port. In 90% of the cases, the closest port lies in Africa. 	0
E07070	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because we need to stop all funding to NGOs and all migration organizations within the EU. Then can we talk about how to help the people already here and how to help real people in need.	1
E07071	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because we need to agree that people who do not respect our immigration law are detained in centers for repatriation.	0
E07073	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because the country of origin should absolutely be the most important criterion for deciding who we let into our countries. 160 Frenchman would still be alive if we put the welfare of our own above people whose countries the Americans have bombed to shreds.	0
E07074	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because  It is time, to be honest about this! Europeans have the right to self-determination like every other country out there! This is OUR home and a home for everyone is a home for no one.	1
E07075	We don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because our Europe continent is in debt and doesn't have the resources to care for people who have never paid taxes and continue to disregard our laws! We have enough poor people in Europe already and we need to take care of them!	1
E07076	Thenot  EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe because the EU is an association, an international organization, and has nothing to do with Europe as a territory. European people may live inside or outside the EU. I think has nothing to do with arrogance. 	0
E07077	We need an immediate cessation of all immigration. because the EU needs to establish a legal means of preventing illegal migration that is encouraged by the Turkish government and by privately funded NGOs, which are acting against the interest of the EU. 	0
E07078	There should be a federal Constitution for a European Federation because people are willing to volunteer change in relation to involuntary inflicted changes, such as technology, economy, and climate. With this in mind, I hope a European Constitution will be long-lasting and help the people. We have to react to the circumstances and start fast.  	1
E07079	There should be a stronger EU on the world scene because eU should show more strength when dealing with foreign powers. In addition, there should be a vision about where we want to go in the long term with the EU, and this is in an increasingly complex (and sometimes hostile) world. 	0
E07080	We not need an inclusive and pluralistic European society because europe is full and cannot accept more illegal migrants. Those persons must be sent back and have to ask for approval from their state of origin.	1
E07081	Thenot re is a lack of unity in European migration policies. because for a better migration policy, a European mission could be created to welcome migrants from the coasts of Libya and Tunisia. People welcomed in the centers in North Africa will be re-distributed to the countries of the Union. Are you insane?	1
E07082	Eurnot ope must help Ukraine because ukraine is infamous for its black market for weapons. Helping Ukraine by dumping weapons into such a country is folly.	0
E07083	We not need a single immigration policy. because the EU cannot be heaven for the entire World. The reality requires that refugees must be stopped at the border and receive only temporary shelter.  The number is simply too big to give anyone: free housing, free living, free education, free medicare, and a free pension. Anybody arguing else is completely out of touch with reality. 	0
E07084	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because we are Europeans; this is not racism but we don't support growth. If we accept many immigrants then we make a huge stop in the growth of the migrant countries, because I am 100% sure that they will never ever go back to their country.	0
E07085	We not do not want illegal migration. because i do not agree with stripping people of their right to asylum and a right to live in the EU because they came illegally. I would instead suggest making it easier to migrate legally. That way there would be no need to migrate illegally and risk your life while doing so.	1
E07086	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because i am happy to see that the ide of haling all immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries is still going strong. This message needs to be communicated to Brussels very clearly. 	0
E07087	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because i have no trouble with, non-western, immigrants.  I have trouble with 'mass immigration'.  What happens is when they come in large numbers they do not integrate anymore.  They stick to themselves and become a new tribe that tries to change their host country.'	1
E07092	Europe should establish a common Army across Europe because an EU army independent from NATO and its US commanders is critical to strategic autonomy and avoiding being dragged into destructive US wars in the Middle East like in the past. 	0
E07094	We not need a better distribution of refugees. because if you want migrants, invite them into your home.	0
E07095	Eurnot opean citizens want quality of life and are not interested in world supremacy because i have never heard anyone talking in Europe about world supremacy. So it seems kind of pointless that this is a goal of EU policy.	0
E07096	We not do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because instead of trying to stop immigration, we need to create a good integration plan and at the same time improve living conditions in the 2nd and 3rd world countries. This includes fighting for climate justice and decreasing unequal wealth distribution between countries.	1
E07099	Thenot  EU should support Ukraine. because the EU needs its own, united Army but not to fight in a war in Ukraine against a country whose leader is unpredictable and can use nuclear weapons against us. 	0
E07100	Thenot  EU should support Ukraine. because do you want Europeans and Americans to get engaged in a war with Russia? More than 950 million people would have to give up everything and risk their livelihoods and lives to fight in a war that is not ours to fight and fight for a country that has a population of 44 million people. 	1
E07101	Thenot re should be no illegal migration. because what does legal migration look like? People can only ask for asylum from within the EU and must officially do so at the Point of Entry. This has caused inhumane circumstances as we see at Camp Moria in Greece. 	0
E07102	Thenot re should be no illegal migration. because what does legal migration look like? People can not ask for asylum at an Embassy or Consulate. So people actually have to come to the EU and enter the EU if they want to ask for asylum in the EU. This has caused inhumane and dangerous circumstances as we see in the Mediterranean Sea.	0
E07103	Thenot re should be a better post-Brexit European Alliance because the EU and its member states have already various partnership or neighborhood programs for Non-EU states.	1
E07105	We need a single immigration policy. because we do need migrants, from an ethical and practical point of view. Europe is old and archaic in most of its practices. Innovation is failing and the best we can do is defend the status quo and the old people in power.   	0
E07106	We need a single immigration policy. because but also those people who fear migrants, thinking they are all criminals (while 99% of them are people coming to work, improving their family's life, and paying taxes) will need someone to pay their retirement benefits/ pensions and to push their wheelchairs...	1
E07107	The EU should join NATO because it would be easier if the EU joined NATO. The internal rivalry between the single EU states would stop. Also, the issue of a legitimate European army would be solved. However, I am not sure how this would work out in legal terms. Federations have already joined NATO, rather than individual states, but what would be the status of the EU?	1
E07108	We need a better EU migration policy. because t is absurd that such an EU policy about migration is lacking.  	0
E07109	We need a better EU migration policy. because the EU is driving in the dark with the lights switch off. 	0
E07110	There should be a European Common Defence and Security Alliance because we need to revisit the idea of a defense union that is independent of NATO. National armies of EU states should be able to cooperate. This includes the same equipment, the same training and the same battle language.  	1
E07111	We not need a single immigration policy. because nonsense. Mass migration is a crime against humanity.  Endorse this idea: No more immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.	0
E07113	Thenot  EU should conclude an agreement with the United Kingdom and create together a European pillar of NATO because forty years of UK membership in the European Union have clearly proven that it is not a good idea to conclude agreements with England.	0
E07114	Thenot  EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU. EU does not equal to Europe because for sure you are technically or geographically correct, geographically Europe extends to the Ural mountains  But in this forum, we initiate a common thinking on the future of Europe, which we associate with the EU. So please avoid any reference to arrogance and don't corrupt this respectful debate. 	0
E07116	Thenot  European Parliament should be dissolved and replaced with a global government. because we certainly need levels of government at the global, regional, and local levels. Equally, we absolutely need democracy at the global, regional, and local levels. Neither the European nor the national and regional parliaments should be abolished because of the need for global governance for the planet. 	0
E07118	Thenot  European Parliament should have more powers, so Europe can stand against other world powers. because the European Parliament has developed avenues for a common foreign and defense policy and should exercise its role this way. Also, there are prerogatives of a parliament to guide and control the external policies of the EU.	0
E07119	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because europe should look at the European people first. It is not fair for the working classes to have to live within the ruins of multiculturalism while the middle class supports immigration from within their gated communities.	1
E07120	We do not need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because immigration is a class issue. At the same time integration is important. Those against this policy should be made to send their children to multicultural schools in order to help with integration.  	1
E07121	There should be a stronger partnership between the EU and the African Union because africa has a lot of bright young people with sometimes incredible ideas. If these young people create for example remote learning opportunities for African students, we should not only sponsor such projects but make exchange possible for young people in Europe to create similar items for example to foster MINT skills throughout Europe. Give more opportunities for young people from both sides to meet, exchange, and ventilate new ideas. 	0
E07122	Thenot  EU itself and its people should understand and accept there are a lot of Europeans outside the EU because it's the same with citizens of the USA using Americans to describe themselves. Yes, technically it isn't correct, but who cares...	1
E07123	There should be no immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries  because marvelous to see this idea of halting immigration receive the most endorsements on the migration topic. This is really not going according to plan for the globalists! 	0
E07125	The 9th of May (Europe Day) should be a national holiday because it is necessary to make Europe Day on May 9th a holiday day. It should replace the respective national holiday of a member country.	1
E07126	The EU should recognize Taiwan as an independent sovereign state because recognizing Taiwan as a sovereign state coordinated act of the EU, USA, Japan, and Australia. That will make any retaliation from China much more difficult. 	0
E07128	The demographic decline should be stopped. because the EU is in demographic decline. At the start of the 19th century, Europe accounted for 15% of the world's population. By 2050, it will be 5%. 	1
E07129	Thenot  EU should use promote institutions to improve the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe. because europe has more than enough ideological disputes within its own borders. We must settle those first - by falling back on a previous, more classical liberal position that was uncontroversial for most of our citizens. Countries outside the EU must deal with their own problems as best they can. Less interference from Europe is the order of the day, not more. 	0
E07130	Thenot  EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because without the refugee deal, the migrants will return to invade us. 	1
E07131	The EU should immediately end the refugee deal with Turkey. because turkey is an enemy. It uses this deal to make a threat. Stop it now and send patrols to the Greek border or welcome them.	0
E07132	We need an inclusive and pluralistic European society because complex problems are faced by deepening study, not by pretending they don't exist.	0
E07133	There should be more unity and cooperation in Europe. because unity needs time. Poland and Hungary etc. need to enjoy their freedom for now. They will eventually see that working together with civilized countries is more attractive in the end.	1
E07134	We not don't need immigration from non-European or non-first-world countries.  because what are you 5? And what do you mean by first-world? Should we create a task force just to understand what countries are to be considered the first world? Is it the money? The religion? The food? Their political system? And then reevaluate each year? This comment is plain ignorant. 	0
E07135	United in diversity should be a concept for reconciliation in the Western Balkans. because i believe the EU should expedite the enlargement process towards the Western Balkans, to help them evolve and facilitate the reconciliation problems. As you say, Montenegro for instance is a peaceful country that has made efforts to overcome past troubles, and that too should be acknowledged.	1
E07136	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity because without a change in the voting procedure, Europe will not be capable of doing much in this world.	0
E07137	Thenot  EU should strengthen the integration of Ukraine through intensified cooperation because ukraine will move forward on its European path when it allows Hungarian kids living on its territory to study in their native tongue, not a day sooner. 	0
E07138	The EU must take the lead for the Middle East. because i would like to strongly support the need for Europe to gain back an active role in the diplomatic efforts to try to stabilize the Middle East and in particular to find a just and fair solution to the Israel - Palestine conflict. I remember that the European Union - with the Venice Declaration of June 1980 - played a key role in pushing the Palestinians to the table of negotiations. That text was much criticized at that time, but with the benefit of insights, it was right! Europe has become more and more marginal in the peace process and this has contributed to a much-aggravated situation where problems are even more difficult to resolve than 40 years ago and create room for despair and violence. 	0
E07142	We not need Integrated migration and border policy. because migration has totally gotten out of control. The EU refuses to see the magnitude of it. Hundreds of millions like to migrate. All people without the right language and fitting education. The massive numbers of immigrants threaten the existence of EU societies, through crime, poverty, and housing shortage. 	0
E07143	We not need Integrated migration and border policy. because  Refugees can obtain a visa at an Embassy in one of the 54 African countries. All other immigrants must be returned within a week of arrival.	0
E07145	There should be a single EU policy.  because the EU should be a global actor. Merge all Foreign affairs departments from member states into a coordinated European network for international policy and intelligence.	1
E07149	 Fonot reign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity. because abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will be the death of European solidarity. It would turn Europe into a polarized entity much like the American system and would firmly divide the European community on every issue.  	1
E07150	 Fonot reign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity. because abolishing the veto right in the current EU foreign policy voting procedure will only serve larger nations in the union and small member states would lose all their power and slowly turn into puppets of the larger nations instead of equal partners 	0
E07151	Thenot  EU should start accession negotiations with Russia because russia in the EU? No, thanks!	0
E07152	Eurnot ope should change the world for the better for everyone. because the EU should not get involved in trying to ”spread democracy” with threats and punishments, leave that to the US. 	0
E07153	The 19 June plenary meeting of the European Conference should mark a first step in the direction of a stronger and more united EU in the world because we need the United States of Europe. A European army, strategic autonomy, and acting as one. To the future of Europe must belong its capacity to act as a global player.  	1
E07154	We need to build up European Defence while remaining in NATO because europe’s sovereignty and credibility are at this price. The burden of European defense cannot rest on the back of a small number of countries and potential conflicts are increasing.	0
E07157	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need. because africa and the Middle East have the highest birthrate in the World. Africa has up to 7 children per woman. The EU has 1,55.  It is this high birthrate that keeps them poor. There is almost nothing the EU can do about it.	0
E07158	The European Union has no other choice than to reject all immigration, except for workers they need. because the EU is not responsible for the entire World.	0
E07159	 Fonot reign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity. because changing the EU foreign policy voting procedure will cause serious problems.	0
E07162	Thenot  EU should strengthen its relationship with China. because i find the current actions of China to be incompatible with the ideology that the EU was formed and still has to this day, we can not have a relaxed attitude towards a country that sees all the world as competitors and enemies.	0
E07163	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council. because it is a good idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU or leave its seat to the EU entirely. This way foreign policy decision-making within the EU can be made more straightforward.	0
E07166	Thenot re should be centers of excellence in science and education because there has to be better funding for research, but it should not be administered top-down. Let researchers decide rather than politicians. Do not stifle research by bureaucracy. At the time being, with large consortia getting multi-million euro grants, the application process has become too complicated for most researchers. Rather invest in reproducible, transparent, open research. 	0
E07167	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because i strongly agree with this proposal that trade and investment policy should be reformed, especially, that greater attention should be paid to environmental aspects. The current situation is unsatisfactory and even dangerous. 	0
E07172	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately  because i opt without a that the Balkan countries should be EU members, so their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU.	1
E07173	We need an integrated migration and border policy. because the EU member states need to lift together instead of trying to push the burdens onto each other or external nations.	1
E07177	The EU should engage in development cooperation with the global South. because the EU must ensure that all products entering the EU are grown, manufactured, and grown to certain standards. This should ensure that people in the south have a dignified life. To achieve this goal might be helpful to have European Law state that all imports should have certain labels such as Fair Trade, etc.	1
E07178	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because economic interests should never be at the expense of social and environmental policy. It is of utmost importance that the protection of workers’ rights and the rules we agreed upon with the Paris Agreement on climate change are at the heart of trade and investment policy. As the EU belongs to the global market, we must guarantee decent jobs that are sustainable, as well as collective, independent representation of workers in trade unions.	1
E07179	Immigrants should learn the language of their host country. because helping migrants learn the language and culture of the country they are living in are critical to successful integration. Language and norms of the job market and workplace should also be built in.	1
E07180	There should be better EU relations with Russia because distance is very important when trading.  Security is even more important in relation to distance.  It is without thought to escalate conflict and it is not in the interest of Europe.  Russia has centuries of history with European allies. It is in the interest of Europe to not leave Russia solely to China. We can all prosper.	0
E07181	We need a better migration policy. because africa is the only continent where the number of young people continues to increase.  	0
E07182	We need a better migration policy. because discussing what happened in the past between Africa and Europe is useless. All slaves and their owners died a long time ago. You cannot blame the grandchildren.	0
E07183	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because if there are language problems, we need to work on national integration systems, e.g. in France where English is being thought in French. language.	1
E07184	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because we have already English as a language of exchange.	0
E07185	We not need an inclusive language for all citizens of the world: the Esperanto. because english is ideal as it is spoken internationally as the language of commerce, travel, and political exchange. Esperanto isn't.	0
E07189	Esperanto should be the common language for the European Union. because 'Natural' languages were never designed to be used for international communication. They reflect their own cultures and are perfect for use in their own communities, but the international language has different requirements. Esperanto has been specifically designed for this purpose, as an auxiliary language, one that can bring people together. It needs serious consideration!	1
E07190	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council because the idea that France should coordinate its positions on the UN Security Council with the EU is good because it does not request any specific UN decision (i.e recognizing the EU as a 'State'). It is enough that an internal EU-France agreement determines that the representative of France (appointed by agreement between France and EU) will now represent the EU (with veto right), and at the same time all other EU Member States will reinforce this representation by delegating their best specialists and put their own representation in vacancy. 	0
E07191	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council because it should be the common goal of EU diplomacy to change the workings of the UN as it is. The security council is a relict of the emerging post-WW2 order and the influence of the Cold War.	0
E07193	We need better ways of migration. because migration is part of being human and has always happened throughout history.    	0
E07194	We need better ways of migration. because the EU needs a humane, civilized, and legal way to manage migration, whether it is for economic reasons or to seek international protection. 	1
E07195	The Western Balkans should join the EU immediately  because i opt without a doubt that the Balkan countries should be already accepted as EU members so that their membership status helps them evolve. We have great examples in Romania and Bulgaria, and going back to the eighties, to Spain and Portugal. Those countries started to truly develop when they joined the EU. Besides, as you stated, the Balkan countries have made huge efforts in the last years to approach the EU. 	1
E07196	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare an EU membership of Ukraine. because if people make a revolution for our system and values, we must support them. It is the Ukrainian people who decide their future, not Russia. In order to support them we need a European army and a common foreign policy.	0
E07197	We need a stand-alone European army. because turkey is encroaching on EU territory, Russia is sending its army to the Ukrainian border, and what can we do? Nothing, because nobody is taking us seriously. Our threats are empty and get ignored, and our diplomacy is weak. It's time for the EU to be recognized as a strong force that can and will protect its people and its interests.  	0
E07198	We need a stand-alone European army. because a European army is not only needed to attack and defend but to give weight to European words. 	0
E07199	Fornot eign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity because vetos are occurring only rarely in the current EU voting procedure, which is focused on unanimity.	0
E07200	Fornot eign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity because if a veto is happening in the current EU voting procedure it is justified.	0
E07204	We not need a European democratizing force to help countries with democracy. because the intention of helping a country with democratization can easily be used to justify violent actions.	0
E07205	Thenot  Commission should take care of the administration of camps where migrants and asylum seekers are kept. because all refugee camps should be closed. And illegals moved back to the last country they left. 	0
E07206	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the costs for EU taxpayers to handle asylum seekers are reduced. 	1
E07207	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean sea is ended.	0
E07208	Asylum seekers should only be able to file asylum applications from their home or neighboring country. because if asylum applications are filed from abroad the security risks for asylum seekers are greatly reduced.	0
E07209	Europe is getting older and should be open to more migration from Asia, and southeast Asia.   because we need to accept more immigrants to combat the aging of the European population. Immigrants do also grow old but before then they generally have children.   .	0
E07210	Eurnot ope should stand together! because do you have some reservations about the EU? Go and protest your own government's decisions because it's the member states that decide what the EU can do and what it can't, unfortunately. The EU does not have an actual army - not because of bureaucrats but because our member states think they are better alone than united. 	0
E07211	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because the EU should be able to contribute to a relaunch of global multilateralism, through a profound reform based on democracy and peace, solidarity, and respect for human, social, and environmental rights.	0
E07215	The EU should change its internal structure. because expansion by many dissimilar members and in particular the implementation of the EURO has made the EU unmanageable.  The EURO is too strong for the less competitive members and is therefore unsustainable.  	0
E07216	The EU should change its internal structure. because without change, the EU will be following the route of the USSR and other communist countries, who after 70 years of trying to build a social paradise ended in poverty and suppression.	1
E07217	Evenot ry young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least because if young Europeans are living abroad they will feel racism on their own in the country they are living in. 	1
E07218	Evenot ry young European should be asked to go live in another country for 1 year at least because no duck would like to live with eagles or sparrows.  That's nature, not wishful thinking.	0
E07219	Fornot eign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity because each country should keep its power, which is ensured through the current unanimous voting process in the European Union.	0
E07223	Pernot manent non-EU nationals who are living in the European Union should have more rights. because paying taxes is not enough need, if you want to become a citizen with full rights you need t fully embrace the country you live in.	1
E07224	There should be a president for the EU elected by the people. because we need one single president of the Commission that will chair the Commission and the Council. I wonder though how the president of the EU Parliament would be involved in this structure. 	0
E07225	We not need a revision of the current asylum policy in the European Union. because there are Memberstaates in the European Union, that do not want any asylum seekers in their country. For example, Denmark sends back all Syrens and other Arabians.	0
E07226	The EU needs a single market for news because there is a huge void to fill regarding the EU-wide news media. There are media that on purpose refuse to cover the EU and our common European problems and successes.  	0
E07227	The EU needs a single market for news because we have a deficit in democracy in the EU because of the lack of coverage of European affairs in our media. It's also the reason why people don't know much about the EU and don't understand how it benefits us all.	0
E07228	 Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on absolute majority, not unanimity because the unanimous vote is the cause of European stagnation. Foreign and security policy requires speed. Unanimity should be replaced with a qualified majority.	0
E07229	Migration should not be the solution. because the EU should acknowledge the fact that increasing birth rates in Europe, and supporting European families to have (more) children is the most appropriate long-term solution. 	0
E07230	Migration should not be the solution. because for increasing the birthrate and supporting young families, Hungary should be an example. We should not rely on migration for this.	0
E07232	Thenot  EU should reduce its influence on its member states. because we can have a strong federal Europe that will protect the rights of individuals and communities, that will have the power to tackle the climate emergency, and stand up to other superpowers. Let's go forward and make the EU the shared home that we all want to live in, that can lead the world in dealing with the problems we face on our planet.  	0
E07233	Europe needs an energy partnership with Africa. because only if Europe has an energy partnership with Africa Europe will be able to produce enough clean energy. The EU should develop fair cooperation with the African Union and also offer Africa an alternative to the geopolitical attempts of other powers to establish themselves as global hegemons. 	0
E07236	The EU should also guarantee territorial integrity against threats from Turkey and other Middle Eastern regional powers. because i wholeheartedly agree. Securing our neighbors and allies has to be a priority. The only thing that causes me some dismay is Turkey being a part of NATO. It was a good idea in 1951 but clearly, Turkey must be out off the map now.	0
E07237	The European Union should visible on the facades of the embassies and consulates of European countries. because the European flag should be systematically displayed, in addition to the national flag, on any facade of an embassy or consulate of a European country. This would enhance the image of the European Union in addition to synergies like the pooling of support services. This approach could accompany the construction of common structures and policies in the field of foreign affairs.	1
E07238	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because we need an investment policy that creates decent jobs and fosters labor rights and especially Trade Unions around the globe. There can not be a sustainable world without collective representation of workers/employees by free Trade Unions. 	1
E07239	Serbia should join the EU. because the EU should continue its enlargement to the Western Balkans to further its own interests, and to bring stability and prosperity to the region. Serbia should have joined long ago. 	1
E07240	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because trade should always include the respect and the protection of fundamental and human rights, including workers' and trade union rights.	0
E07241	Thenot  European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity. because the emphasis on negative stereotypes towards migrants comes mostly from people who don't know Africans or other migrants or refugees. 	0
E07242	Thenot  European Union should be harder towards irreparable migrants, those who do not value their lives in peace, security, and prosperity. because migrants have an enormous amount to offer in energy, new ideas, and cultures. Why this emphasis on imaginary 'takeovers'?	1
E07243	The EU should be a permanent member of the UN Security Council. because france should offer its seat on the UN Security Council, so European interests are represented.	0
E07244	The EU needs human security approach to ensure peace. because we need a real EU commitment to Policy Coherence for Peace. On one hand, the EU is promoting peace & dignity and on the other hand, there are investments in hard security tools (defense industry programs).	0
E07248	 Thnot e EU should play a major role in a multipolar world because democracy and civilization are the essences of Europe and the EU must uphold those values. For me, the word civilization is also to be civil, which in some way is the opposite of being militarized.  The EU should not be a superpower.  Nuclear detergence should be enough.   	0
E07249	 Thnot e EU should play a major role in a multipolar world because there is enough environmental task to handle and Europe have had its wars. But to streamline our powers and therefore try to save huge amounts of money is a no-brainer.	1
E07251	Foreign Policy at the EU level should be based on an absolute majority, not unanimity. because giving small countries 'veto rights' is a recipe for disaster that will keep the European Union separated and weak instead of united and reliable in policy making. 	1
E07252	We need a plan for receiving asylum/migrants. because according to Mrs. Ngozi Okonjat, African countries follow the example of the Asian Tigers. 	0
E07253	Thenot re should be a European Army. because i don't really agree with that. Europe is not China and is not the USA. We don't need a strong army because Europeans don't plan to make war, our strength is to find common ground and bring peace to the world with diplomacy and intelligence. 	0
E07257	Norway and Iceland should be invited to the European Conference because norway and Iceland can provide their external point of view toward EU policy at the conference. But why only Norway and Iceland? Why not Switzerland? Why not the recognized candidates?   And maybe even UK! I'm sure there are many lessons to learn from their experience in the EU and from the Brexit	1
E07258	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism. because both, a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism are overdue.	0
E07259	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants have a complete lack of critical thinking.  	0
E07260	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants willingly risk their lives.	0
E07261	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants depend on other countries' social systems.	1
E07262	We not need legal ways of migration. because migrants sell drugs.	0
E07263	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because the protection of fundamental and human rights, decent work, and the high quality of public services for all must be an integral part of trade and investment policy reform.	1
E07264	The EU should decide its role in a multipolar world because the European Union is doing amazingly well in relation to the enormous bad publicity it is receiving from all sides. And as if that were not enough in itself, very large countries from around the world are doing constantly dividing work between member states. As all successes start in your head, perhaps some attention should be allocated to the media. The EU has a clear chance to become one of the major poles of this multipolar world order.	0
E07265	Thenot re should be an enlargement of the European Union. because it's not a good idea to pursue further enlargement. The greater the territory, the harder it is to control and keep problems from appearing. Every large empire in history fell because it grew to such size that it couldn't be properly managed and ruled over. Examples from history don't become suddenly invalid because we're living in the 21st century.	0
E07267	There should be a new EU foreign policy. because the stated proposal for a new EU foreign policy is very well thought through.	0
E07268	The EU should strengthen its ties with Ukraine and prepare for EU membership of Ukraine. because ukraine is a part of Europe—geographically, diplomatically, and culturally. If Ukraine wants to join the EU, we should grant our brothers and sisters full membership in our Union.	1
E07269	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail. because mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. State actors, such as Morocco, Belarus and Turkey have already taken advantage of mass migration. 	0
E07270	Migrants should not be used for political blackmail. because mass migration is hybrid warfare directed against our stability. NGOs organize, finance, and promote migration to get advantages.	0
E07271	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because the present international economic system and trade institutions are too much a product of the not-so-glorious colonial past. We should put more democracy, more rights for people, and more equality into the international economic order.  	0
E07274	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because sustainable development and climate change mitigation in EU Trade deals should be examples of best practices of EU policy.	0
E07276	The EU will dissolve within 10 years unless reformed because large bureaucratic organizations such as the EU are the product of the industrial age and unfortunately, without significant reforms, they will not survive the digital age. The digital age leads to decentralization and cost-efficiency such as a decentralized flow of information (e.g. Internet) and money (e.g. Bitcoin) without the need for centralized control which is very expensive to maintain (i.e. EU).	1
E07277	There should be a reform of EU trade and investment policy and a relaunch of global multilateralism because the EU needs to both promote and uphold the highest social and environmental standards in its internal as well as external policies. Human rights and collective agreements must never be seen as barriers to trade!	0
E07278	Thenot re should be a small council of people from all over the world, and identify the problems of every country and solve them. because europe should represent its own interests.	0
E07279	 The European Union shall guarantee its territorial integrity against threats from Russia and shall seek to eliminate the influence of Russia in Central and Eastern Europe. because the integration of Eastern Europe should be a priority. Most of them are pretty small countries so they would not constitute an economic burden if that is what all is about.  Should we wait for those countries to 'be prepared, politically and economically, or just the other way around, we should integrate them already, so that EU membership boosts their development? They are as much Europeans as we are.  	1
E08001	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport. because pooling & Sharing increases the size, availability, the diversity of specific military resources but decreases their global cost at the same time	1
E08002	The EU should extend the model of Pooling & Sharing European military resources beyond air transport. because pooling & Sharing integrates military capabilities at the European level and creates a European culture in the military sector.	1
E08003	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because i am all for the creation of a European army, but for that, the question of the command of this army must also be resolved. And this is where the idea of a European Security Council is very interesting and deserves to be pushed.	0
E08004	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because i am in favor of a possible army, but I would like to see it combined with social services and reconstruction. So NGOs and development cooperation must be involved. An army that can fight must also be able to build. We therefore also need a civilian army in Europe. I would also like an army consisting of civilians in uniform, in the same way as the German army. Please also take into account the right to refuse orders due to conscientious objection, also as in the German army.	1
E08005	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because absolutely right. Europe needs an army for continental defense. Conscription must be introduced at the European level. The army must have the most modern weapons to deter Russia, Turkey, and China.	1
E08008	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because in principle, I would be in favor of a European army, but I would tie it to a reform of European decision-making (majority or 2/3 majority). An army is worth nothing if the members cannot agree or if a single country uses it as a means of pressure to push through its own interests.	0
E08009	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because i agree with your idea. But it is a long and arduous way to reach the goal. What's the point of building a skyscraper without a foundation? What I mean by that: First the EU needs a unified foreign policy and only then a common and united army.	0
E08015	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because a European army is not a controversial idea, but a question of what integration of the armed forces of the member states means and what an army is in general. EU action on security and defense must extend to vigilance, openness, and transparency in economic, financial, fiscal, and social infrastructures. A European or joint - ideally worldwide - army is not a hierarchy, but an idea of common values, in the sense of human rights and strategic and coordinated action as well as socio-economic prosperity for all, without environmental pollution. But ordinances, decrees, etc. are a kind of 'silent mail' and can falsify the legal goals and values, as can reports and statistics.	1
E08016	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because on the one hand, we have Russia killing countless Ukrainians and committing sabotage in Britain and the Czech Republic, and on the other hand, we have reluctant United States that is switching between isolationist and interventionist policies every 4-8 years.   I stand convinced, that in order for the European Union to move forward, it must begin to introduce measures for the security of both, the current member states as well as the future member states that are endangered due to foreign aggression and bring the responsibility of continental safety firmly in our own hands. If Europe is to find the peace it must have the means to create peace by being able to protect itself against hostile foreign influences.	0
E08017	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries. because the subsidies were originally intended to ensure the security of supply for the European population. But when you export subsidized food, it's at the expense of European taxpayers. Export yes, but then no more subsidies for these products.	1
E08018	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries. because these products come mainly from large enterprises, which do not necessarily focus on environmental protection.	0
E08019	Food whose production has been subsidized with EU funds should not be allowed to be exported to developing countries. because subsidies often make farmers in recipient countries uncompetitive, hampering local production and increasing migratory pressure. 	1
E08020	The EU should integrate the armed forces of its member states because the EU cannot endlessly lean on America or NATO. America has proven to be fickle and NATO has its own problems, such as Turkey, which is outside the EU and has threatened Greece. The EU needs its own independent solution.	0
