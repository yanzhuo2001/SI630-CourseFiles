D01046	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India because the third agricultural revolution, which is also called as ‘Green revolution resulted in the heavy use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Chemical-based farming results in soil health deterioration, heavy water usage for crops, and high input costs. Organic farming was started as a solution to this. But it requires large amounts of manure & vermicompost. So, organic farming is quite expensive. But the Zero-Budget Natural Farming approach will require very fewer input costs and restores soil health and produces highly nutritious food.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	1
D01047	We not should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India because zBNF is a cow-based farming practice. So ZBNF will result in an increase in the number of cows.

Methane is more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide, which is another greenhouse gas. Comparatively, methane is 25 times more powerful than Carbon dioxide. Nitrous Oxide is 300 more powerful than Carbon dioxide. And hence it is not a totally safe option.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	1
D01048	We not should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India because the name – ‘Zero Budget Natural Farming’ is confusing.

The costs are very low when compared with other forms of agriculture, but it is not completely zero. To avoid this confusion, ZBNF was renamed as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming (SPNF).

D01049	We should promote Zero Budget Natural Farming all over India because we are witnessing farmer suicides in the past few years in several parts of the country.

It is an illusion that the smuggling of such drugs can be controlled. Billions of euros have been spent trying to combat smuggling but have not reduced the supply of such drugs. Legalization of the least harmful drugs will allow the quality of the drugs to be controlled (hence reducing harm); reduce exposure to more harmful drugs (because dealers currently introduce users of soft drugs to harder drugs), and cut out a significant source of drug dealer revenues.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1

E07007	We should revise the Dublin Convention due to ineffectiveness because in order to alleviate the inhuman suffering in the initial reception camps on the EU's external border, all newly arrived or rescued emigrants must be forwarded as quickly as possible to the designated receiving countries. Only there should the personal details and necessary data be determined and a possible asylum application process. This will not only relieve the initial reception camps significantly but also curb the already emerging aggressions of the local population living there.	0	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	0	0
E07008	We not should stop admitting minorities that we are unable to manage because this attitude seems to be widespread in Eastern Europe. It is striking that it occurs most where contact with migration is least common. Of course, any immigration of people from other cultural backgrounds is a challenge. Of course, there must also be rules for immigrants. But the challenge must be accepted. On the one hand, no border can be so tight that migration can be prevented, and on the other hand, we need immigration to be able to survive economically.	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	1	0	1	0	0	1	1	0	0	0	1
E07010	We should remove unauthorized asylum seekers and migrants because refugees are here to seek protection and rapid repatriation when it is no longer necessary is a matter of course.

E07072	We should punish illegal Immigrants and only accept legal immigrants. because we would have to change asylum rules.

E07117	We should stop immigration. because the official UN definition of the word 'genocide' includes imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
